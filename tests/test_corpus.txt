farming in ancient egyptflax farming is growing crops or keeping animals by people for food and raw materials farming is part of agriculture history agriculture started thousands of years ago but no one knows for sure how old it is the development of farming gave rise to the neolithic revolution whereby people gave up nomadic hunting and became settlers in what became cities agriculture and domestication probably started in the fertile crescent the nile valley the levant and mesopotamia the area called fertile crescent is now in the countries of iraq syria turkey jordan lebanon israel and egypt wheat and barley are some of the first crops people grew people probably started agriculture slowly by planting few crops but still gathered many foods from the wild people may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change farming can feed many more people than hunter gatherers can feed on the same amount of land kinds of farming agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals but also growing other things like flowers and nursery plants manure or dung animal hides skins or furs leather animals fungi fibers cotton wool hemp and flax biofuels and drugs marijuana opium many people still live by subsistence agriculture on small farm they can only grow enough food to feed the farmer his family and his animals extra food or animals are sold for money or other things the farmer cannot grow the yield is the amount of food grown on given amount of land and it is often low this is because subsistence farmers are generally less educated and they have less money to buy equipment drought and other problems sometimes cause famines where yields are low deforestation can provide new land to grow more food this provides more nutrition for the farmer family but can be bad for the country and the surrounding environment over many years in rich countries farms are often fewer and larger during the th century they have become more productive because farmers are able to grow better varieties of plants use more fertilizer use more water and more easily control weeds and pests many farms also use machines so fewer people can farm more land there are fewer farmers in rich countries but the farmers are able to grow more this kind of intensive agriculture comes with its own set of problems farmers use lot of chemical fertilizers pesticides chemicals that kill bugs and herbicides chemicals that kill weeds these chemicals can pollute the soil or the water they can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals causing outbreaks of these pests the soil can be damaged by erosion blowing or washing away salt buildup or loss of structure irrigation adding water from rivers can pollute water and lower the water table these problems have all got solutions and modern young farmers usually have good technical education agriculture techniques fertilizers crop rotation weed removal breeding fencing ranching plantation farmers select plants with better yield taste and nutritional value they also choose plants that can survive plant disease and drought and are easier to harvest centuries of artificial selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants the crops produce better yield with other techniques use of fertilizers chemical pest control irrigation some companies have been searching for new plants in poor countries and genetically modify these plants to improve them they then try to patent the seeds and sell them back to the poor countries new plants were created with genetic engineering one example of genetic engineering is modifying plant to resist herbicide food it is important for there to be enough food for everyone the food must also be safe and good people say it is

of the world many millions of years ago because of this many animals and plants live in australia that do not live anywhere else these include animals like the kangaroo the koala the emu the kookaburra and the platypus people first arrived in australia more than years ago these native australians are called the australian aborigines for the history of australia see history of australia most of the australian colonies having been settled from britain became mostly independent democratic states in the and all six combined as federation on january the first prime minister of australia was edmund barton in australia is member of the united nations and the commonwealth of nations it is parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy with elizabeth ii as queen of australia and head of state and governor general who is chosen by the prime minister to carry out all the duties of the queen in australia regions and cities australia has six states two major mainland territories

and adelaide the largest inland city is canberra which is also the nation capital the largest city is sydney australia is very big country but much of the land is very dry and the middle of the continent is mostly desert only the areas around the east west and south coast have enough rain and suitable climate not too hot for many farms and cities history aboriginal people photograph of arrernte men of central australia in corroboree in the australian aboriginal people arrived in australia about years ago or even earlier until the arrival of british settlers in the aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land they lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways an example of aboriginal land management was the cumberland plain where sydney is now every few years the aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees this meant that lot of grass grew back but not many big trees kangaroos like to live on grassy plains but not in forests the kangaroos that lived on the plain were good food supply for the aboriginal people sometimes aborigines would name person after an animal and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population aboriginal people did not usually build houses except huts of grass leaves and bark they did not usually build walls or fences and there were no horses cows or sheep in australia that needed to be kept in pens the only aboriginal buildings that are known are fish traps made from stones piled up in the river and the remains of few stone huts in victoria and tasmania the aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth in some parts of australia the people used sharp flaked stone spearheads but most aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood australia has lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making the boomerang was used in some areas for sport and for hunting the aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them they believed that they had grown from the land so it was like their mother and they belonged to the land terra australis in the dutch merchants traded with the islands of batavia now indonesia to the north of australia and several different dutch ships touched on the coast of australia the dutch governor van diemen sent abel tasman on voyage of discovery and he found tasmania which he named van diemen land its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it the british government was sure that there must be very large land in the south that had not been explored they sent captain james cook to the pacific ocean his ship hms endeavour carried the famous scientists sir joseph banks and dr solander who were going to tahiti where they would watch the planet venus pass in front of the sun captain cook secret mission was to find terra australis the land of the south the voyage of discovery was very successful because they found new zealand and sailed right around it then they sailed westward at last boy william hicks who was up the mast spotted land on the horizon captain cook named that bit of land point hicks they sailed up the coast and captain cook named the land that he saw new south wales at last they sailed into large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food joseph banks and dr solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were they collected hundreds of plants to take back to england captain cook saw the aboriginal people with their simple way of life he saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit but there were no houses and no fences in most parts of the world people put up house and fence or some marker to show that they own the land but the aboriginal people did not own the land in that way they belonged to the land like baby belongs to its mother captain cook went home to england and told the government that no one owned the land this would later cause terrible problem for the aboriginal people settlement captain arthur phillip raises the british flag at sydney in in the in england laws were tough many people were poor and gaols jails were full person could be sentenced to death for stealing loaf of bread many people were hung for small crimes but usually they were just thrown in gaol often they were sent away to the british colonies in america but by the the colonies in america became the united states they were free from british rule and would not take england convicts any more so england needed to find new and less populated place by the the gaols of england were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships the government decided to make settlement in new south wales and send some of the convicts there in the first fleet of eleven ships set sail from portsmouth carrying convicts sailors marines few free settlers and enough food to last for two years their leader was captain arthur phillip they were to make new colony at the place that captain cook had discovered named botany bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists captain phillip found that botany bay was flat and windy there was not much fresh water he went with two ships up the coast and sailed into great harbor which he said was the finest harbor in the world there were many small bays on the harbor so he decided on one which had good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on on january the flag was raised and new south wales was claimed in the name of king george iii of england and the new settlement was called sydney for the first few years of the settlement things were very difficult no one in the british government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make new colony nobody had chosen them carefully there was only one man who was farmer there was no one among the convicts who was builder brick maker or blacksmith no one knew how to fix the tools when they broke all of the cattle escaped there were no cooking pots all the plants were different so no one knew which ones could be eaten it was probable that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation somehow the little group of tents with hut for the governor arthur phillip and another hut for the supply of food grew into small town with streets bridge over the stream windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships by the there was fine brick house for the governor there was also hospital and convict barracks and beautiful church which are still standing today settlements had spread out from sydney firstly to norfolk island and to van diemen land tasmania and also up the coast to newcastle where coal was discovered and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to large herd spanish merino sheep had been brought to sydney and by farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of england while the settlement was growing in new south wales it was also growing in tasmania the climate in tasmania was more like that in england and farmers found it easy to grow crops there exploration governor lachlan macquarie was the th governor of new south wales and one who though that australia could be rich and free place because australia is such very large land it was easy to think that it might be able to hold very large number of people in the early days of the colony great number of explorers went out searching for good land to settle on when the settlers looked west from sydney they saw range of mountains which they called the blue mountains they were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no one could find their way through them in gregory blaxland william lawson and year old called william charles wentworth crossed the blue mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming road was built and the governor lachlan macquarie founded the town of bathurst on the other side miles from sydney some people like captain charles sturt were sure that there must be sea in the middle of australia and set out to find it many of the explorers did not prepare very well or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year some died like burke and wills ludwig leichhardt got lost twice the second time he was never seen again major thomas mitchell was one of the most successful explorers he mapped the country as he went and his maps remained in use for more than years he travelled all the way to what is now western victoria and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there the henty brothers had come from tasmania had built themselves house had successful farm and fed the major and his men on roast lamb and wine self government the gold rushes of new south wales and victoria started in leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold the population grew across south east australia and made great wealth and industry by the gold rushes had made some poor people very rich the transportation of convicts to australia ended in the and and more changes came the people in australia wanted to run their own country and not be told what to do from london the first governments in the colonies were run by governors chosen by london soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy william wentworth started the australian patriotic association australia first political party in to demand democratic government in the city councils started and some people could vote new south wales legislative council had its first elections in again with some limits on who could vote in limited self government was given by london to new south wales victoria south australia and tasmania in the right to vote was given to all men over in south australia the other colonies soon followed women were given the vote in the parliament of south australia in and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections australians had started parliamentary democracies all across the

the drinks apple juice and cider usually cider contains little alcohol about as much as beer the regions of brittany in france and cornwall in england are known for their apple ciders apple cultivars if one wants to grow certain type of apple it is not possible to do this by planting seed from the wanted type the seed will have dna from the apple that the seeds came from but it will also have dna from the apple flower that pollinated the seeds which may well be different type this means that the tree which would grow from planting would be mixture of two in order to grow certain type of apple small twig or scion is cut from the tree that grows the type of apple desired and then added on to specially grown stump called rootstock the tree that grows will only create apples of the type needed there are more than known cultivars of apples different cultivars are available for temperate and subtropical climates one large collection of over apple cultivars is at the national fruit collection in england most of these cultivars are grown for eating fresh dessert apples however some are grown simply for cooking or making cider cider apples are usually too tart to eat immediately however they give cider rich flavor that dessert apples cannot most popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp colorful skin easy shipping disease resistance red delicious apple shape and popular flavor are also needed modern apples are usually sweeter than older cultivars this is because popular tastes in apples have become different most north americans and europeans enjoy sweet apples extremely sweet apples with hardly any acid taste are popular in asia and india in the united kingdom in the united kingdom there are about different types of apples the most common apple type grown in england is the bramley seedling which is popular cooking apple apple orchards are not as common as they were in the early when apples were rarely brought in from other countries organizations such as common ground teach people about the importance of rare and local varieties of fruit apple day is celebrated each october in many countries in north america many apples are grown in temperate parts of the united states and canada in many areas where apple growing is important people have huge celebrations annapolis valley apple blossom festival held five days every spring may june in nova scotia shenandoah apple blossom festival held six days every spring in winchester virginia washington state apple blossom festival held two weeks every spring april may in wenatchee washington varieties of apples

algebra is part of mathematics often called math in the united states and maths or numeracy in the united kingdom it uses variables to represent value that is not yet known when an equals sign is used this is called an equation very simple equation using variable is in this example or it could also be said equals five this is called solving for besides equations there are inequalities less than and greater than special type of equation is called the function this is often used in making graphs algebra can be used to solve real problems because the rules of algebra work in real life and numbers can be used to represent the values of real things physics engineering and computer programming are areas that use algebra all the time it is also useful to know in surveying construction and business especially accounting people who do algebra need to know the rules of numbers and mathematic operations used on numbers starting with adding subtracting multiplying and dividing more advanced operations involve exponents starting with squares and square roots interestingly many of these rules can also be used on the variables algebra was first used to solve equations and inequalities two examples are linear equations the equation of line mx and quadratic equations which has variables that are squared power of two number that is multiplied by itself for example how to factor polynomials is needed for quadratic equations history early forms of algebra were developed by the babylonians and the greeks however the word algebra is latin form of the arabic word al jabr casting and comes from mathematics book al maqala fi hisab al jabr wa al muqabilah essay on the computation of casting and equation written in the th century by persian mathematician muhammad ibn mūsā al khwārizmī who was muslim born in khwarizm in uzbekistan he flourished under al ma moun in baghdad iraq through ad and died around ad the book was brought into europe and translated into latin in the th century the book was then given the name algebra the ending of the mathematician name al khwarizmi was changed into word easier to say in latin and became the english word algorithm examples here is simple example of an algebra problem sue has candies ann has candies they decide to share so that they have the same number of candies these are the steps you can use to solve the problem to have the same number of candies ann has to give some to sue let represent the number of candies ann gives to sue sue candies plus must be the same as ann candies minus this is written as subtract from both sides of the equation this gives what happens on one side of the equals sign must happen on the other side too for the equation to still be true so in this case when was subtracted from both sides there was middle step of after person is comfortable with this the middle step is not written down add to both sides of the equation this gives divide both sides of the equation by this gives the answer is six if ann gives sue candies they will have the same number of candies to check this put back into the original equation wherever was this gives which is true they both now have candies with practice algebra can be used when faced with problem that is too hard to solve any other way problems such as building freeway designing cell phone or finding the cure for disease all require algebra writing algebra as in most parts of mathematics adding to or plus is written as subtracting from or minus is written as dividing by or over is written as or is more commonly used in algebra multiplying by or times can be written in ways or just yz the multiplication symbol is usually not used because it looks too much like the letter which is often used as variable also when multiplying larger expression parentheses can be used when we multiply number and letter in algebra we write the number in front of the letter when the number is then the is not written because times any number is that number and so it is not needed functions and graphs linear equation for an important part of algebra is the study of functions since functions often appear in equations that we are trying to solve function is like box you can put number or numbers into and get certain number out when using functions graphs can be powerful tools in helping us to study the solutions to equations graph is picture that shows all the values of the variables that make the equation or inequality true usually this is easy to make when there are only one or two variables the graph is often line and if the line does not bend or go straight up and down it can be described by the basic formula mx the variable is the intercept of the graph where the line crosses the vertical axis and is the slope or steepness of the line this formula applies to the coordinates of graph where each point on the line is written in some math problems like the equation for line there can be more than one variable and in this case to find points on the line one variable is changed the variable that is changed is called the independent variable then the math is done to make number the number that is made is called the dependent variable most of the time the independent variable is written as and the dependent variable is written as for example in this is often put on graph using an axis going left and right and axis going up and down it can also be written in function form so in this example we could put in for and get put in for would get and for would get so there would be line going thru the points and as seen in the graph to the right if has power of it is straight line if it is squared or some other power it will be curved if it uses an inequality then usually part of the graph is shaded either above or below the line rules of algebra in algebra there are few rules that can be used for further understanding of equations these are called the rules of algebra while these rules may seem senseless or obvious it is wise to understand that these properties do not hold throughout all branches of mathematics therefore it will be useful to know how these axiomatic rules are declared before taking them for granted before going on to the rules reflect on two definitions that will be given opposite the opposite of is reciprocal the reciprocal of is rules commutative property of addition commutative means that function has the same result if the numbers are swapped around in other words the order of the terms in an equation do not matter when the operator of two terms is an addition the commutative property of addition is applicable in algebraic terms this gives note that this does not apply for subtraction commutative property of multiplication when the operator of two terms is an multiplication the commutative property of multiplication is applicable in algebraic terms this gives note that this does not apply for division when associative property of addition associative refers to the grouping of numbers the associative property of addition implies that when adding three or more terms it doesn matter how these terms are grouped algebraically this gives note that this does not hold for subtraction see the distributive property associative property of multiplication the associative property of multiplication implies that when multiplying three or more terms it doesn matter how these terms are grouped algebraically this gives note that this does not hold for division distributive property the distributive property states that the multiplication of number by another term can be distributed for instance do not confuse this with the associative properties for instance additive identity property identity refers to the property of number that it is equal to itself in other words there exists an operation of two numbers so that it equals the variable of the sum the additive identity property states that the sum of any number and is that number this also holds for subtraction multiplicative identity property the multiplicative identity property states that the product of any number and is that number this also holds for division additive inverse property the additive inverse property is somewhat like the opposite of the additive identity property when an operation is the sum of number and its opposite and it equals that operation is valid algebraic operation algebraically it states the following additive inverse of is multiplicative inverse property the multiplicative inverse property entails that when an operation is the product of number and its reciprocal and it equals that operation is valid algebraic operation algebraically it states the following multiplicative inverse of is advanced algebra in addition to elementary algebra or basic algebra there are advanced forms of algebra taught in colleges and universities such as abstract algebra linear algebra and universal algebra this includes how to use matrix to solve many linear equations at once abstract algebra is the study of things that are found in equations going beyond numbers to the more abstract with groups of numbers many math problems are about physics and engineering in many of these physics problems time is variable time uses the letter using the basic ideas in algebra can help reduce math problem to its simplest form making it easier to solve difficult problems energy is force is mass is acceleration is and speed of light is sometimes this is used in some famous equations like ma and mc although more complex math beyond algebra was needed

atom drawing of lithium atom in the middle is the nucleus which in this case has four neutrons blue and three protons red orbiting it are its three electrons lithium atom model showing nucleus with four neutrons blue three protons red and orbited by three electrons black classification smallest recognised division of chemical element properties mass to kg electric charge zero an atom is the basic unit that makes up all matter there are many different types of atoms each with its own name mass and size these different atoms are called chemical elements the chemical elements are organized on the periodic table examples of elements are hydrogen and gold atoms are very small but the exact size changes depending on the element atoms range from to nanometers in width one nanometer is about times smaller than the width of human hair this makes atoms impossible to see without special tools equations must be used to see the way they work and how they interact with other atoms atoms join together to make molecules for example two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom combine to make water molecule when atoms join together it is called chemical reaction every atom is made up of three kinds of smaller particles called protons which are positively charged neutrons which have no charge and electrons which are negatively charged the protons and neutrons are heavier and stay in the middle of the atom they are called the nucleus they are surrounded by cloud of electrons which are very light in weight and are attracted to the positive charge of the nucleus this attraction is called electromagnetic force the number of protons neutrons and electrons an atom has tells us what element it is hydrogen for example has one proton no neutrons and one electron the element sulfur has protons neutrons and electrons the number of protons is the atomic number the number of protons and neutrons together is the atomic weight atoms move faster when they are in gas form because they are free to move than they do in liquid form and solid matter in solid materials the atoms are tightly packed next to each other so they vibrate but are not able to move there is no room as atoms in liquids do history the word atom comes from the greek ἀτόμος atomos indivisible from not and τόμος cut the first historical mention of the word atom came from works by the greek philosopher democritus around bc atomic theory stayed as mostly philosophical subject with not much actual scientific investigation or study until the development of chemistry in the in french chemist antoine lavoisier defined the term element for the first time he said that an element was any basic substance that could not be broken down into other substances by the methods of chemistry any substance that could be broken down was compound in english philosopher john dalton suggested that elements were tiny solid balls made of atoms dalton believed that all atoms of the same element have the same mass he said that compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine according to dalton in certain compound the atoms of the compound elements always combine the same way in british scientist robert brown looked at pollen grains in water under his microscope the pollen grains appeared to be jiggling brown used dalton atomic theory to describe patterns in the way they moved this was called brownian motion in albert einstein used mathematics to prove that the seemingly random movements were caused by the reactions of atoms and by doing this he conclusively proved the existence of the atom in scientist dmitri mendeleev published the first version of the periodic table the periodic table groups elements by their atomic number how many protons they have this is usually the same as the number of electrons elements in the same column or period usually have similar properties for example helium neon argon krypton and xenon are all in the same column and have very similar properties all these elements are gases that have no colour and no smell also they are unable to combine with other atoms to form compounds together they are known as the noble gases the physicist thomson was the first person to discover electrons this happened while he was working with cathode rays in he realized they had negative charge unlike protons positive and neutrons no charge thomson created the plum pudding model which stated that an atom was like plum pudding the dried fruit electrons were stuck in mass of pudding protons in scientist named ernest rutherford used the geiger marsden experiment to prove that most of an atom is in very small space called the atomic nucleus rutherford took photo plate and covered it with gold foil and then shot alpha particles made of two protons and two neutrons stuck together at it many of the particles went through the gold foil which proved that atoms are mostly empty space electrons are so small they make up only of an atom mass ernest rutherford in niels bohr introduced the bohr model this model showed that electrons travel around the nucleus in fixed circular orbits this was more accurate than the rutherford model however it was still not completely right improvements to the bohr model have been made since it was first introduced in chemist frederick soddy found that some elements in the periodic table had more than one kind of atom for example any atom with protons should be helium atom usually helium nucleus also contains two neutrons however some helium atoms have only one neutron this means they truly are helium because an element is defined by the number of protons but they are not normal helium either soddy called an atom like this with different number of neutrons an isotope to get the name of the isotope we look at how many protons and neutrons it has in its nucleus and add this to the name of the element so helium atom with two protons and one neutron is called helium and carbon atom with six protons and six neutrons is called carbon however when he developed his theory soddy could not be certain neutrons actually existed to prove they were real physicist james chadwick and team of others created the mass spectrometer the mass spectrometer actually measures the mass and weight of individual atoms by doing this chadwick proved that to account for all the weight of the atom neutrons must exist in german chemist otto hahn became the first person to create nuclear fission in laboratory he discovered this by chance when he was shooting neutrons at uranium atom hoping to create new isotope however he noticed that instead of new isotope the uranium simply changed into barium atom smaller atom than uranium apparently hahn had broken the uranium atom this was the world first recorded nuclear fission reaction this discovery eventually led to the creation of the atomic bomb further into the th century physicists went deeper into the mysteries of the atom using particle accelerators they discovered that protons and neutrons were actually made of other particles called quarks the most accurate model so far comes from the schrödinger equation schrödinger realized that the electrons exist in cloud around the nucleus called the electron cloud in the electron cloud it is impossible to know exactly where electrons are the schrödinger equation is used to find out where an electron is likely to be this area is called the electron orbital structure and parts parts helium atom with the nucleus shown in red and enlarged embeded in cloud of electrons the complex atom is made up of three main particles the proton the neutron and the electron the isotope of hydrogen hydrogen has no neutrons just the one proton and one electron positive hydrogen ion has no electrons just the one proton and one neutron these two examples are the only known exceptions to the rule that all other atoms have at least one proton one neutron and one electron each electrons are by far the smallest of the three atomic particles their mass and size is too small to be measured using current technology they have negative charge protons and neutrons are of similar size and weight to each other protons are positively charged and neutrons have no charge most atoms have neutral charge because the number of protons positive and electrons negative are the same the charges balance out to zero however in ions different number of electrons this is not always the case and they can have positive or negative charge protons and neutrons are made out of quarks of two types up quarks and down quarks proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark and neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark nucleus the nucleus is in the middle of an atom it is made up of protons and neutrons usually in nature two things with the same charge repel or shoot away from each other so for long time it was mystery to scientists how the positively charged protons in the nucleus stayed together they solved this by finding particle called gluon its name comes from the word glue as gluons act like atomic glue sticking the protons together using the strong nuclear force it is this force which also holds the quarks together that make up the protons and neutrons diagram showing the main difficulty in nuclear fusion the fact that protons which have positive charges repel each other when forced together the number of neutrons in relation to protons defines whether the nucleus is stable or goes through radioactive decay when there are too many neutrons or protons the atom tries to make the numbers the same by getting rid of the extra particles it does this by emitting radiation in the form of alpha beta or gamma decay nuclei can change through other means too nuclear fission is when the nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei releasing lot of stored energy this release of energy is what makes nuclear fission useful for making bombs and electricity in the form of nuclear power the other way nuclei can change is through nuclear fusion when two nuclei join together or fuse to make heavier nucleus this process requires extreme amounts of energy in order to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the protons as they have the same charge such high energies are most common in stars like our sun which fuses hydrogen for fuel electrons electrons orbit or travel around the nucleus they are called the atom electron cloud they are attracted towards the nucleus because of the electromagnetic force electrons have negative charge and the nucleus always has positive charge so they attract each other around the nucleus some electrons are further out than others in different layers these are called electron shells in most atoms the first shell has two electrons and all after that have eight exceptions are rare but they do happen and are difficult to predict the further away the electron is from the nucleus the weaker the pull of the nucleus on it this is why bigger atoms with more electrons react more easily with other atoms the of the nucleus is not strong enough to hold onto their electrons and atoms lose electrons to the strong attraction of smaller atoms radioactive decay some elements and many isotopes have what is called an unstable nucleus this means the nucleus is either too big to hold itself together or has too many protons or neutrons when this happens the nucleus has to get rid of the excess mass or particles it does this through radiation an atom that does this can be called radioactive unstable atoms continue to be radioactive until they lose enough mass particles that they become stable all atoms above atomic number protons lead are radioactive there are three main types of radioactive decay alpha beta and gamma alpha decay is when the atom shoots out particle having two protons and two neutrons this is essentially helium nucleus the result is an element with atomic number two less than before so for example if beryllium atom atomic number went through alpha decay it would become helium atomic number alpha decay happens when an atom is too big and needs to get rid of some mass beta decay is when neutron turns into proton or proton turns into neutron in the first case the atom shoots out an electron in the second case it is positron like an electron but with positive charge the end result is an element with one higher or one lower atomic number than before beta decay happens when an atom has either too many protons or too many neutrons gamma decay is when an atom shoots out gamma ray or wave it happens when there is change in the energy of the nucleus this is usually after nucleus has already gone through alpha or beta decay there is no change in the mass or atomic number or the atom only in the stored energy inside the nucleus every radioactive element or isotope has what is named half life this is how long it takes half of any sample of atoms of that type to decay until they become different stable isotope or element large atoms or isotopes with big difference between the number of protons and neutrons will therefore have long half life because they must lose more neutrons to become stable marie curie discovered the first form of radiation she found the element and named it radium she was also the first female recipient of the nobel prize frederick soddy conducted an experiment to observe what happens as radium decays he placed sample in light bulb and waited for it to decay suddenly helium containing protons and neutrons appeared in the bulb and from this experiment he discovered this type of radiation has positive charge james chadwick discovered the neutron by observing decay products of different types of radioactive isotopes chadwick noticed that the atomic number of the elements was lower than the total atomic mass of the atom he concluded that electrons could not be the cause of the extra mass because they barely have mass enrico fermi used the neutrons to shoot them at uranium he discovered that uranium decayed lot faster than usual and produced lot of alpha and beta particles he also believed that uranium got changed into new element he named hesperium otto hanh and fritz strassmann repeated fermi experiment to see if the new element hesperium was actually created they discovered two new things fermi did not observe by using lot of neutrons the nucleus of the atom would split producing lot of heat energy also the fission products of uranium were already discovered thorium palladium radium radon and lead fermi then noticed that the fission of one uranium atom shot off more neutrons which then split other atoms creating chain reactions he realised that this process is called nuclear fission and could create huge amounts of heat energy that very discovery of fermi led to the development of the first nuclear bomb code named trinity references other websites general information on atomic structure atomic

th century map of the sky astronomy is natural science it is the study of everything outside the atmosphere of earth it studies celestial objects such as stars galaxies planets moons asteroids comets and nebulae and processes such as supernovae explosions gamma ray bursts and cosmic microwave background radiation this includes the physics chemistry of those objects and processes the word astronomy comes from the greek words astron which means star and nomos which means law person who studies astronomy is called an astronomer astronomy is one of the oldest sciences ancient people used the positions of the stars to navigate and to find when was the best time to plant crops astronomy is very similar to astrophysics related subject physical cosmology is concerned with studying the universe as whole and the way the universe changed over time astronomy is not the same as astrology the belief that the patterns the stars and the planets may affect human lives since the th century there have been two main types of astronomy observational and theoretical astronomy observational astronomy uses telescopes and cameras to observe or look at stars galaxies and other astronomical objects theoretical astronomy uses maths and computer models to predict what should happen the two often work together the theoretical predicts what should happen and the observational shows whether the prediction works history of astronomy ancient early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars they used maps of the constellations and stars for religious reasons and also to work out the time of year early civilisations such as the maya people and the ancient egyptians built simple observatories and drew maps of the stars positions they also began to think about the place of earth in the universe for long time people thought earth was the center of the universe and that the planets the stars and the sun went around it this is known as geocentrism ancient greeks tried to explain the motions of the sun and stars by taking measurements mathematician named eratosthenes was the first who measured the size of the earth and proved that the earth is sphere theory by another mathematician named aristarchus was that the sun is in the center and the earth is moving around it this is known as heliocentrism only few people thought it was right the rest continued to believe in the geocentric model most of the names of constellations and stars come from greeks of that time arabic astronomers made many advancements during the middle ages including improved star maps and ways to estimate the size of the earth they also learned from the ancients by translating greek books into arabic renaissance to modern era drawings of the moon by galileo his drawings were more detailed than anyone before him because he used telescope to look at the moon during the renaissance priest named nicolaus copernicus thought from looking at the way the planets moved that the earth was not the center of everything based on previous works he said that the earth was planet and all the planets moved around the sun this brought back the old idea of heliocentrism physicist called galileo galilei built his own telescopes and used them to look more closely at the stars and planets for the first time he agreed with copernicus the catholic church decided that galileo was wrong he had to spend the rest of his life under house arrest heliocentric ideas were soon improved by johannes kepler and isaac newton who invented the theory of gravity after galileo people made better telescopes and used them to see farther objects such as the planets uranus and neptune they also saw how stars were similar to our sun but in range of colours and sizes they also saw thousands of other faraway objects such as galaxies and nebulae modern era the th century saw important changes in astronomy in karl jansky discovered radio emission from outside the earth when trying to isolate source of noise in radio communications marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the electromagnetic spectrum to observe the sky those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy allowing more discoveries to be made the opening of this new window on the universe saw the discovery of entirely new things for example pulsars which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space the waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that it implied an artificial source the period after world war saw more observatories where large and accurate telescopes are built and operated at good observing sites normally by governments for example bernard lovell began radio astronomy at jodrell bank using leftover military radar equipment by the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world similarly the end of the saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at mauna kea in hawaii good site for visible and infra red telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies the next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry this allowed telescopes to be placed in space on satellites space telescopes gave access for the first time in history to the entire electromagnetic spectrum including rays that had been blocked by the atmosphere the rays gamma rays ultraviolet light and parts of the infra red spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched as with other parts of the spectrum new discoveries were made from satellites were launched to be replaced with more accurate and better satellites causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum discoveries discoveries broadly come in two types bodies and phenomena bodies are things in the universe whether it is planet like our earth or galaxy like our milky way phenomena are events and happenings in the universe bodies for convenience this section has been divided by where these astronomical bodies may be found those found around stars are solar bodies those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything else larger are cosmic bodies solar planets asteroids comets galactic stars diffuse objects nebulas clusters compact stars white dwarves neutron stars black holes cosmic galaxies galaxy clusters superclusters phenomena burst events are those where there is sudden change in the heavens that disappears quickly these are called bursts because they are normally associated with large explosions producing burst of energy they include supernovas novas periodic events are those that happen regularly in repetitive way the name periodic comes from period which is the length of time required for wave to complete one cycle periodic phenomena include pulsars variable stars noise phenomena tend to relate to things that happened long time ago the signal from these events bounce around the universe until it seems to come from everywhere and varies little in intensity in this way it resembles noise the background signal that pervades every instrument used for astronomy the most common example of noise is static seen on analogue televisions the principal astronomical example is cosmic background radiation methods instruments telescopes are the main tool of observing they take all the light in big area and put in into small area this is like making your eyes very big and powerful astronomers use telescopes to look at things that are far away and dim telescopes make objects look bigger closer brighter spectrometers study the different wavelengths of light this shows what something is made of many telescopes are in satellites they are space observatories techniques there are way astronomers can get better pictures of the heavens light from distant source reaches sensor and gets measured normally by human eye or camera for very dim sources there may not be enough light particles coming from the source for it to be seen one technique that astronomers have for making it visible is using integration which is like longer exposures in photography integration astronomical sources do not move much only the rotation and movement of the earth causes them to move across the heavens as light particles reach the camera over time they hit the same place making it brighter and more visible than the background until it can be seen telescopes at most observatories and satellite instruments can normally track source as it moves across the heavens making the star appear still to the telescope and allowing longer exposures also images can be taken on different nights so exposures span hours days or even months in the digital era digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by computer which overlays the images after correcting for movement aperture synthesis with radio telescopes smaller telescopes can be combined together to create big one which works like one as big as the distance between the two smaller telescopes adaptive optics adaptive optics means changing the shape of the mirror or lens while looking at something to see it better data analysis data analysis is the process of getting more information out of an astronomical observation than by simply looking at it the observation is first stored as data this data will then have various techniques used to analyse it fourier analysis fourier analysis in mathematics can show if an observation over length of time is changing periodically changes like wave if so it can extract the frequencies and the type of wave pattern and find many things including new planets fields good example of fields comes from pulsars which pulse regularly in radio waves these turned out to be similar to some but not all of type of bright source in rays called low mass ray binary it turned out that all pulsars and some lmxbs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found those lmxbs that were not neutron stars turned out to be black holes this section attempts to provide an overview of the important fields of astronomy their period of importance and the terms used to describe them it should be noted that astronomy in the modern era has been divided mainly by electromagnetic spectrum although there is some evidence this is changing fields by body solar astronomy solar astronomy is the study of the sun the sun is the closest star to earth at around million miles away it is the easiest to observe in detail observing the sun can help us understand how other stars work and are formed changes in the sun can affect the weather and climate on earth stream of charged particles called the solar wind is constantly sent off from the sun the solar wind hitting the earth magnetic field causes the northern lights studying the sun helped people understand how nuclear fusion works planetary astronomy planetary astronomy is the study of planets moons dwarf planets comets and asteroids as well as other small objects that orbit stars the planets of our own solar system have been studied in depth by many visiting spacecraft such as cassini huygens saturn and the voyager and galactic astronomy galactic astronomy is the study of distant galaxies studying distant galaxies is the best way of learning about our own galaxy as the gases and stars in our own galaxy make it difficult to observe galactic astronomers attempt to understand the structure of galaxies and how they are formed through the use of different types of telescopes and computer simulations fields by electromagnetic spectrum radio astronomy radio telescope mhd hydrodynamics is used in astronomy for mathematically modelling how gases behave strong magnetic fields found around many bodies can drastically change how these gases behave affecting things from star formation to the flows of gases around compact stars this makes mhd an important and useful tool in astronomy other fields gravitational wave astronomy gravitational wave astronomy is the study of the universe in the gravitational wave spectrum so far all astronomy that has been done has used the electromagnetic spectrum gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime emitted by very dense objects changing shape which include white dwarves neutron stars and black holes because no one has been able to detect gravitational waves directly the impact of gravitational wave astronomy has been very limited related pages solar system planet satellite natural

such as garage or large designs such as whole city architecture often overlaps with civil engineering and architects and civil engineers often work together history romanesque groin vault in the past people built huts and wood houses to protect themselves from the weather for safety they were often close together great civilizations like the ancient egyptians built large temples and structures like the great pyramids of giza the ancient greeks and romans made what we now call classical architecture the romans working over years ago copied the arch from the etruscans who copied it from the mesopotamians the stone columns which still hold up so many important buildings like the parthenon in athens were simply copied from the first wooden posts simpler building in hungary classical architecture was very formal and it always obeyed laws it used symmetry which really means balance and it used proportion which means keeping shapes in certain ways the golden mean was rule or law which said to put it very simply if you are making room or any other thing it will work best if you always make the long side times longer than the short side there are many laws in classical architecture like how high the middle of an arched bridge needs to be which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be these laws were learned from thousands of years of experience and they are as true today as they were years ago in some parts of the world like india the architecture is famous for carving the stone on temples and palaces different architectural styles were made in china japan southeast asia africa mexico and central and south america later people in western europe in the middle ages made romanesque architecture then gothic architecture gothic buildings have tall pointed windows and arches many churches have gothic architecture castles were also built at this time in eastern europe churches usually had domes people added their own ideas and decoration to the classical architecture of the past the renaissance brought return to classical ideas architecture can have many styles such as the curved guggenheim museum in new york city in the late th century with the industrial revolution people began to invent machines to make things quickly and cheaply many factories and mills were built during or after this revolution decades later in the victorian era architects like george fowler jones and decimus burton still followed the gothic style to build new churches up to this point buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and masonry used to construct them gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller for example the cathedral in ulm germany is over feet tall however building with stone has its limits and building too tall could result in collapse this happened to the beauvais cathedral which was never completed new technology allows new kinds of buildings such as for the willis tower in chicago towards the end of the th century with second industrial revolution steel became much cheaper architects began to use inventions like metal girders and reinforced concrete to build an example is the eiffel tower in paris buildings can now be built taller than ever before we call them skyscrapers this new technology has made us free from traditional limitations and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated replaced or abandoned cheap strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls especially for office buildings modernism is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies and its beginnings can been seen as early as modernism can also refer to specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late th century and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then which are sometimes called post modern many of the world greatest structures were built by modern day architects such as frank lloyd wright

roman theatre in alexandria egypt archaeology or archeology is the study of the past by looking for the remains and artifacts historical things left by the people who lived long ago these remains can include old coins tools buildings and inscriptions archaeologists the people who study archaeology use these remains to understand how people lived archaeologists are like historians they think it is important to understand the past fieldwork when archaeologists do fieldwork they look for remains often by digging deep in the ground when things are found or even when nothing is found the results of the fieldwork are taken back to the place where the archaeologist base is maybe university or museum they record everything they found by writing down on paper or entering the information into computer so that they can build picture of everything that is found as settlements places where people lived in groups change and grow old buildings are often buried to make space for new buildings ancient rome for example is now up to feet metres below the present city this is why archaeological fieldwork is expensive and why it takes long time fields of interest archaeologists do not all study the same civilizations they specialize in different areas of interest some fields of interest include ancient egypt these specialists are called egyptologists ancient china or the vikings archaeologists study every civilization that is known especially the ones where there is no written history they can study any time period for example one might study the beginning of human life in africa or study world war ii marine archaeologists study things that are now underwater they search for sunken ships or cities that have been lost under the sea sites stonehenge in england is famous archaeological site or place other famous sites include the roman forum angkor wat machu picchu and great zimbabwe in many countries governments and other groups of people protect important sites so that they will not be destroyed and so that visitors can always come and see them sometimes archaeological sites are found when foundations are dug for new buildings archaeologists have to work quickly when this happens because people who are building often don have lot of time many times as soon as the archaeologists are done with their work the remains that they have found will be covered over unless they are very important related pages civilization references other websites archaeology citizendium
animals are eukaryotic organisms wiith many cells they do not use light to get energy as plants do the study of animals is called zoology animals use different ways to get energy from other living things they usually eat other living things but some are parasites or have photosynthetic protists as symbionts plants are also multicellular eukaryotic organisms but most animals are mobile meaning they can move around animals take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide this cellular respiration is part of their metabolism chemical working in both these ways they are different from plants also the cells of animals have different cell membranes to other eukaryotes like plants and fungi grouping animals there are many types of animals the common animals most people know are only about of the animal kingdom when biologists look at animals they find things that certain animals have in common they use this to group the animals in biological classification they think several million species exist but they have only identified about one million animals can mainly be divided into two main groups the invertebrates and the vertebrates vertebrates have backbone or spine invertebrates do not vertebrates are fish or fishes both ways are correct amphibians reptiles birds mammals some invertebrates are insects spiders crustaceans molluscs like snail or squid worms jellyfish in scientific usage humans are considered animals in everyday nonscientific usage humans are often not considered to be animals life styles the animal mode of nutrition is called heterotrophic because they get their food from other living organisms some animals eat only plants they are called herbivores other animals eat only meat and are called carnivores animals that eat both plants and meat are called omnivores the environments animals live in vary greatly by the process of evolution animals adapt to the habitats they live in fish is adapted to its life in water and spider is adapted to life catching and eating insects mammal living on the savannahs of east africa lives quite different life from sea mammal like dolphin or porpoise catching fish in the sea the fossil record of animals goes back about million years to the ediacaran period or somewhat earlier during the whole of this long time animals have been constantly evolving so that the animals alive on earth today are very different from those on the edges of the sea floor in the ediacaran the study of ancient life is called palaeontology related pages list of animal phyla references
acceleration is measure of how fast velocity changes acceleration is the change of velocity divided by the change of time acceleration is vector and therefore includes both size and direction examples an object was moving north at meters per second the object speeds up and now is moving north at meters per second the object has accelerated an apple is falling down it starts falling at meters per second at the end of the first second the apple is moving at meters per second the apple has accelerated at the end of the second second the apple is moving down at meters per second the apple has accelerated again jane is walking east at kilometers per hour jane velocity does not change jane acceleration is zero tom was walking east at kilometers per hour tom turns and walks south at kilometers per hour tom has had nonzero acceleration sally was walking east at kilometers per hour sally slows down after sally walks east at kilometers per hour sally has had nonzero acceleration acceleration due to gravity finding acceleration acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object acceleration can be found by using be maverick savageeeeee loganpual com shop where is the velocity at the start is the velocity at the end is the time at the start is the time at the end sometimes the change in velocity is written as sometimes the change in time is written as δt in difficult situations the acceleration can be calculated using mathematics in calculus acceleration is the derivative of the velocity with respect to time units of measurement acceleration has its own units of measurement for example if velocity is measured in meters per second and if time is measured in seconds then acceleration is measured in meters per second squared other words acceleration can be positive or negative when the acceleration is negative but the velocity does not change direction it is sometimes called deceleration for example when car brakes it decelerates physicists usually only use the word acceleration newton second law of motion newton laws of motion are rules for how things move these rules are called laws of motion isaac newton is the scientist who first wrote down the main laws of motion according to newton second law of motion the force something needs to accelerate an object depends on the object mass the amount of stuff the object is made from or how heavy it is the formula of newton second law of motion is where is the acceleration is the force and the mass this formula is very well known and it is very important in physics newton second law of motion in short newton second law is often one of the first things that physics students learn deceleration deceleration is the opposite of acceleration this means that something slows down instead of speeding up for example when car brakes it is decelerating
boot device is used to start computer it is named after boot which fits on the foot the word bootstrap is also closely related and means to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better it comes from the english phrase pull yourself up by your own bootstraps before computer can operate normally it must have operating system instructions that tell it how to perform basic functions boot device loads the operating system into the memory of the computer devices that can boot computer are usually boot disks or boot drives normally hard drive but can be floppy disk or cd some network computers use boot chips that get the operating system over network web phones also use such chips to identify the user to the cell network boot card standards may let many users boot kiosk computers with full privacy and access to all applications they own there are also boot boards or boot add in cards that are more permanent than boot cards some people refer to the boot device as just boot and non boot devices as data device although it is not the computer but the operating system that cares about the difference between these origin the boot in boot device is the same as booting or starting up this is short for bootstrapping or to start with simple stuff and make complex stuff out of it other pages booting category software

bankruptcy is legal process which happens when person or an organisation does not have enough money to pay all of its debts legally they are insolvent where it is person who cannot pay their debts the person creditors may ask the court to appoint trustee in bankruptcy this is professional accountant who is appointed by the court and they will take control of the bankrupt person assets some assets are protected by law but the trustee in bankruptcy will sell off all of the other assets and use the proceeds to pay as much of that person debts as possible after the process is complete the person is discharged from bankruptcy and the person is free from any further liability to pay those claims but normally that person will be limited in their ability to borrow money again because their credit rating will be damaged where it is an organisation who cannot pay their debts the creditors may ask the court to appoint liquidator the liquidator does very similar job to the trustee in bankruptcy except that there are no assets which are protected so the liquidator can sell everything once all of the assets of the organisation have been sold the organisation is then dissolved and no longer exists organisations do not get discharged from bankruptcy in the same way that living person does insolvency or bankrupcy people often confuse the terms bankruptcy and insolvency and sometimes they use one word when they really mean the other insolvency usually just means that someone does not have enough money to pay their debts or sometimes that the total amount of their debts is worth more than the total amount of their assets bankruptcy is formal legal process in front of the courts although the two terms are connected just because person is insolvent does not necessarily mean that they will go into bankruptcy alternatives to bankruptcy many countries have alternatives to bankruptcy to try and allow people and businesses to try and avoid the bankruptcy process in various countries individual people can try and reach individual voluntary arrangements or ivas with their creditors this means that the creditors agree to take less money to discharge their debts there are similar processes for companies and other organisations and they go by various different names in different countries but in many countries they are called schemes of arrangement bankruptcy protection in many countries company or business can ask the courts for bankruptcy protection to try and protect the business so that the creditors cannot destroy all of the physical capital and goodwill by breaking it apart and moving it away the aim of this is provide is more time for the business to reorganise itself and to work out new deal between the owners and the people the business owes money in many countries this is called going into administration however not all countries have bankruptcy protection laws for businesses debt slavery often creditor threatens debtor with debt slavery in many parts of the world in some cases the debtor does not know that they have right to go bankrupt this is human rights problem in some countries also some creditors continue to harass debtor even though

northern half of belgium wallonia where the people speak french in the southern half and the brussels capital region in the middle where french is mostly spoken with some dutch the population is about dutch speaking flemish people french speaking walloons and german speaking so called deutschbelgier on the border with germany to look after these groups belgium has complicated system of government history the seventeen provinces orange brown and yellow areas and the bishopric of liège green philippe of belgium current king the name belgium comes from gallia belgica this was roman province in the northernmost part of gaul before roman invasion in bc the belgae mix of celtic and germanic peoples lived there the germanic frankish tribes during the th century brought the area under the rule of the merovingian kings slow shift of power during the th century led the kingdom of the franks to change into the carolingian empire the treaty of verdun in divided the region into middle and west francia they were vassals either of the king of france or of the holy roman emperor many of these fiefdoms were united in the burgundian netherlands of the th and th centuries the eighty years war divided the low countries into the northern united provinces and the southern netherlands southern netherlands were ruled by the spanish and the austrian habsburgs this made up most of modern belgium after the campaigns of in the french revolutionary wars the low countries were added into the french first republic this ended austrian rule in the area adding back the low countries formed the united kingdom of the netherlands this happened at the end of the first french empire in the belgian revolution was in leopold became king on this is now celebrated as belgium national day episode of the belgian revolution of by egide charles gustave wappers museum of ancient art brussels the berlin conference of gave control of the congo free state to king leopold ii this was for him personally and not for the country of belgium starting in about many people did not like how he treated the congolese people in the belgian state took control of the colony it was then called the belgian congo germany invaded belgium in this was part of world war the opening months of the war were very bad in belgium during the war belgium took over the of ruanda urundi modern day rwanda and burundi after the first world war the prussian districts of eupen and malmedy were added into belgium in the country was again invaded by germany in and under german control until after world war ii the people made king leopold iii leave his throne in this is because they thought he helped the germans in the belgian congo stopped being under belgian rule two years later ruanda urundi also became free belgium joined nato as founding member government and politics since belgium is federal state divided into three regions and three communities regions brussels capital region flemish region or flanders walloon region or wallonia communities flemish community french community of belgium german speaking community of belgium it has system of government known as constitutional monarchy meaning that it has monarch but that the monarch does not rule the country and that government is elected democratically belgium has had its own monarchy since king albert ii left the throne on july and the current king is philippe in belgium the government is elected between mid and late after no clear result in the election belgium had no official government until elio di rupo became prime minister flanders and wallonia both also have their own regional governments and there is notable independence movement in flanders charles michel is currently the prime minister geography belgium is next to france germany luxembourg and the netherlands its total area is square kilometers the land area alone is km² belgium has three main geographical regions the coastal plain is in the north west the central plateau are part of the anglo belgian basin the ardennes uplands are in the south east the paris basin reaches small fourth area at belgium southernmost tip belgian lorraine the coastal plain is mostly sand dunes and polders further inland is smooth slowly rising landscape there are fertile valleys the hills have many forests the plateaus of the ardennes are more rough and rocky they have caves and small narrow valleys signal de botrange is the country highest point at metres ft provinces belgium is divided into three regions flanders and wallonia are divided into provinces the third

chemistry is the science of chemical elements and compounds chemistry is branch of science that deals with chemical elements and compounds and how these things work together it is the study of the materials things that make up our bodies and everything in the world around us history before people studied substances to figure out how to do things such as turn lead into gold but no one managed to do that this was called alchemy alchemists separated the air into many parts and isolated the noble gases from it they also processed special minerals from mine in sweden to get rare earth metals radioactivity was also discovered today chemists have discovered different elements some are very common like oxygen many are very rare and expensive like platinum some cannot be found on earth and can only be made in labs like rutherfordium since the the increased understanding of physics has changed chemists theories about chemical reactions with smaller and faster computers chemists have built better tools for analyzing substances these tools have been sent to study chemicals on mars police also use those tools to study evidence from crime scenes types of chemistry there are several types of chemistry analytical chemistry looks at which chemicals are in things for example looking at how much arsenic is in food organic chemistry looks at things that have carbon in them for example making acetylene inorganic chemistry looks at things that do not have carbon in them one example is making an integrated circuit large area of chemistry is polymer chemistry this looks at plastics one example is making nylon because plastics are made of carbon polymer chemistry is part of organic chemistry another area is biochemistry this looks at the chemistry of living things an example would be seeing how arsenic poisons people biochemistry is also part of organic chemistry there are many other small branches of chemistry concepts of chemistry basic concepts the basic unit of an element is called an atom an atom is the smallest building block that you can cut an element into without the element breaking down turning into lighter element for example through nuclear fission or radioactive decay chemical compound is substance made up of two or more elements in compound two or more atoms are joined together to form molecule the tiniest speck of dust or drop of liquid that one can see is made up of many millions or billions of these molecules mixtures are substances where chemicals are mixed but not reacted an example would be mixing sand and salt this can be undone again to produce salt and sand separately chemical compounds are changed by chemical reaction an example would be heating sodium bicarbonate common baking soda it will make water carbon dioxide and sodium carbonate this reaction cannot be undone one very important concept in chemistry is that different atoms interact with one another in very specific proportions for example two hydrogen atoms interacting with one oxygen atom lead to the water molecule this relationship is known as the law of constant proportions and leads to the idea of stoichiometry term that refers to the ratios of different atoms in chemical compounds for example in water there are always exactly hydrogen atoms to oxygen atom in carbon dioxide there are exactly oxygen atoms for carbon atom these relationships are described using chemical formulas such as two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom and co one carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms mole because atoms of different elements react with one another in very specific proportions but atoms of different elements have different weights chemists often describe the amount of different elements and compounds in terms of the number of moles mole of any element contains the same number of atoms atoms the atomic mass of an element can be used to see how much of the element makes mole for example the atomic mass of copper is about that means about grams of copper metal has mole of atoms the atomic mass of chlorine is about that means grams of chlorine has mole of atoms in it moles can be used to see how many molecules are in chemical compounds too copper ii chloride is an example cucl is its chemical formula there is one copper atom and two chlorine atoms add all the molar masses of the elements together to get the molar mass of the chemical compound that means in grams of copper ii chloride there is one mole of copper ii chloride molecules this concept is used to calculate how much chemicals are needed in chemical reaction if no reactants chemicals that are reacted should be left if too much reactant is used there will be some reactants left in the chemical reaction acids and bases acids and bases are common chemicals acids release ions when in water and bases release oh ions when in water acids can react with bases the ion is taken from the acid by the base this makes water salt is also made when an acid and base react together an example would be reacting hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh hydrochloric acid releases and cl ions in water the base releases na and oh ions the and the oh react to make water there is solution of sodium chloride nacl left sodium chloride is salt usefulness chemistry is very useful in everyday life and makes up the foundation of many branches of science most objects are made by chemists people who do chemistry chemists are constantly working to find new and useful substances chemists make new drugs and materials like paints that we use every day safety this chemist is wearing safety glasses lab coat and gloves he is looking at rock from the moon many chemicals are harmless but there are some chemicals that are dangerous for example mercury ii chloride is very toxic chromates can cause cancer tin ii chloride pollutes water easily hydrochloric acid can cause bad burns some chemicals like hydrogen can explode or catch fire to stay safe chemists experiment with chemicals in chemical lab they use special equipment and clothing to do reactions and keep the chemicals contained the chemicals used in drugs and in things like bleach have been tested to make sure they are safe if used correctly

computer science is the study of how to manipulate manage transform and encode information there are many different areas in computer science some of the areas consider problems in an abstract way some areas need special machines called computers person who works with computers will often need mathematics science and logic in order to make and use computers common tasks for computer scientist asking questions this is so that they can find new and easier ways to do things and the way to approach problems with this information asking the right question computers can do some things easily for example simple math or sorting out list of names from to but computers cannot answer questions when there is not enough information or when there is no real answer also computers may take too much time to finish long tasks for example it may take too long to find the shortest way through all of the towns in the usa so instead computer will try to make close guess computer will answer these simpler questions much faster answering the question algorithms are specific set of instructions or steps on how to complete task think about playing cards for example computer scientist wants to sort these cards first he sorts them by suits then he orders them by number jack queen king and ace there are many ways to sort the cards by deciding on set of steps of how to sort the cards he has created an algorithm after making the algorithm the scientist needs to test whether the algorithm works then the scientist can see how well his algorithm sorts the cards simple but slow algorithm could be drop the cards pick them up and check whether they are sorted if they are not do it again this method will work but it should take very long time better algorithm would be too finding the first card the smallest suit and smallest number of diamonds and putting it at the start after this he looks for the second card and so on this works much faster and does not need much space this sorting algorithm has name selection sort computer science began during world war ii and separated from the other sciences during the and now computer science has its own methods and has its own technical terms it is related to electrical engineering mathematics and language science computer science looks at the theoretical parts of computers computer engineering looks at the physical parts of

drawing of usual modern desktop computer computer is machine mostly electronic that is able to take information input and process it to make new information output calculating machines have existed for much of human history early examples are the astrolabe and the abacus there are four main processing steps in computer and they are inputting storage outputting and processing modern computers are very different from early computers they can do billions of calculations per second most people have used personal computer in their home or at work computers do many different jobs where automation is useful some examples are controlling traffic lights vehicle computers security systems washing machines and digital televisions computer user can control it by user interface input devices include keyboard mouse buttons and touch screens some very sophisticated computers can also be controlled with voice commands or hand gestures or even brain signals through electrodes implanted in the brain or along nerves computers can be designed to do almost anything with information computers are used to control large and small machines which in the past were controlled by humans they are also in homes where they are used for things such as listening to music reading the news and writing modern computers are electronic computer hardware they do mathematical arithmetic very quickly but computers do not really think they only follow the instructions in their software programs the software uses the hardware when the user gives it instructions and gives useful output computer programs are designed or written by computer programmers few programmers write programs in the computer own language called machine code most programs are written using programming language like java and fortran these programming languages are more like the language with which one talks and writes every day the computer translates the user instructions into binary code machine code that the computer will understand and do what is needed history of computers the jacquard loom was one of the first programmable devices definition computer is programmable electronic device designed to accept data perform prescribed mathematical and logical operations at high speed and display the results of these operations all under the control of software mainframes desktop and laptop computers tablets and smartphones are some of the different types of computers an electronic machine which helps in solving problems quickly and easily it solves problems according to instructions given to it by the computer user called programs or software it is digital machine that uses binary digits used in all fields automation most humans have problem with math to show this try doing in your head it is hard to remember all the steps people made tools to help them remember where they were in maths problem the other problem people have is that they have to do the same problem over and over and over again cashier had to make change every day in her head or with piece of paper that took lot of time and made mistakes so people made calculators that did those same things over and over this part of computer history is called the history of automated calculation which is fancy phrase for the history of machines that make it easy for me to do this same maths problem over and over without making mistakes the abacus the slide rule the astrolabe and the antikythera mechanism which dates from about bc are examples of automated calculation machines programming people did not want machine that would do the same thing over and over again for example music box is machine that plays the same music over and over again some people wanted to be able to tell their machine to do different things for example they wanted to tell the music box to play different music every time they wanted to be able to program the music box to order the music box to play different music this part of computer history is called the history of programmable machines which is fancy phrase for the history of machines that can order to do different things if know how to speak their language one of the first examples of this was built by hero of alexandria ad he built mechanical theater which performed play lasting minutes and was operated by complex system of ropes and drums these ropes and drums were the language of the machine they told what the machine did and when some people argue that this is the first programmable machine historians disagree on which early machines are computers many say the castle clock an astronomical clock invented by al jazari in is the first known programmable analog computer others say the first computer was made by charles babbage al jazari showed the zodiac the solar and lunar orbits crescent moon shaped pointer travelling across gateway that made some doors to open every hour and five robotic musicians who play music when levers hit them the length of day and night could be changed aka re programmed every day in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year ada lovelace is considered to be the first programmer the computing era at the end of the middle ages people in europe thought math and engineering were more important in wilhelm schickard made mechanical calculator other europeans made more calculators after him they were not modern computers because they could only add subtract and multiply you could not change what they did to make them do something like play tetris because of this we say they were not programmable now engineers use computers to design and plan in joseph marie jacquard used punched paper cards to tell his textile loom what kind of pattern to weave he could use punch cards to tell the loom what to do and he could change the punch cards which means he could program the loom to weave the pattern he wanted this means the loom was programmable charles babbage wanted to make similar machine that could calculate he called it the analytical engine because babbage did not have enough money and always changed his design when he had better idea he never built his analytical engine as time went on computers were used more people get bored easily doing the same thing over and over imagine spending your life writing things down on index cards storing them and then having to go find them again the census bureau in had hundreds of people doing just that it was expensive and reports took long time then an engineer worked out how to make machines do lot of the work herman hollerith invented tabulating machine that would automatically add up information that the census bureau collected the computing tabulating recording corporation which later became ibm made his machines they leased the machines instead of selling them makers of machines had long helped their users understand and repair them and ctr tech support was especially good because of machines like this new ways of talking to these machines were invented and new types of machines were invented and eventually the computer as we know it was born analog and digital computers in the first half of the th century scientists started using computers mostly because scientists had lot of math to figure out and wanted to spend more of their time thinking about science questions instead of spending hours adding numbers together for example if they had to launch rocket ship they needed to do lot of math to make sure the rocket worked right so they put together computers these analog computers used analog circuits which made them very hard to program in the they invented digital computers and soon made them easier to program high scale computers scientists figured out how to make and use digital computers in the and scientists made lot of digital computers and as they did they figured out how to ask them the right sorts of questions to get the most out of them here are few of the computers they built edsac was one of the first computers that remembered what you told it even after you turned the power off this is called von neumann architecture konrad zuse machines the was the first working machine that used binary arithmetic binary arithmetic means using yes and no to add numbers together you could also program it in the was proved to be turing complete turing complete means that it is possible to tell this particular computer anything that it is mathematically possible to tell computer it is the world first modern computer the non programmable atanasoff berry computer which used vacuum tubes to store yes and no answers and regenerative capacitor memory the harvard mark big computer that you could kind of program the army ballistics research laboratory eniac which could add numbers the way people do using the numbers through and is sometimes called the first general purpose electronic computer since konrad zuse of used electromagnets instead of electronics at first however the only way to reprogram eniac was by rewiring it several developers of eniac saw its problems they invented way to for computer to remember what they had told it and way to change what it remembered this is known as stored program architecture or von neumann architecture john von neumann talked about this design in the paper first draft of report on the edvac distributed in number of projects to develop computers based on the stored program architecture started around this time the first of these was completed in great britain the first to be demonstrated working was the manchester small scale experimental machine ssem or baby while the edsac completed year after ssem was the first really useful computer that used the stored program design shortly afterwards the machine originally described by von neumann paper edvac was completed but was not ready for two years nearly all modern computers use the stored program architecture it has become the main concept which defines modern computer the technologies used to build computers have changed since the but many current computers still use the von neumann architecture microprocessors are miniaturized devices that often implement stored program cpus in the computers were built out of mostly vacuum tubes transistors replaced vacuum tubes in the because they were smaller and cheaper they also need less power and do not break down as much as vacuum tubes in the technologies were based on integrated circuits microprocessors such as the intel made computers smaller cheaper faster and more reliable by the became small and cheap enough to replace mechanical controls in things like washing machines the also saw home computers and personal computers with the evolution of the internet personal computers are becoming as common as the television and the telephone in the household in nokia started to call some of its mobile phones the series multimedia computers and after the launch of the apple iphone in many are now starting to add the smartphone category among real computers in if smartphones are included in the numbers of computers in the world the biggest computer maker by units sold was no longer hewlett packard but rather nokia kinds of computers there are many types of computers personal computer workstation computer mainframe computer minicomputer supercomputer embedded system tablet computer desktop computer is small machine that has screen which is not part of the computer most people keep them on top of desk which is why they are called desktop computers laptop computers are computers small enough to fit on your lap this makes them easy to carry around both laptops and desktops are called personal computers because one person at time uses them for things like playing music surfing the web or playing video games there are bigger computers that many people at time can use these are called mainframes and these computers do all the things that make things like the internet work you can think of personal computer like this the personal computer is like your skin you can see it other people can see it and through your skin you feel wind water air and the rest of the world mainframe is more like your internal organs you never see them and you barely even think about them but if they suddenly went missing you would have some very big problems an embedded computer also called embedded system is computer that does one thing and one thing only and usually does it very well for example an alarm clock is an embedded computer it tells the time unlike your personal computer you cannot use your clock to play tetris because of this we say that embedded computers cannot be programmed because you cannot install more programs on your clock some mobile phones automatic teller machines microwave ovens cd players and cars are operated by embedded computers all in one pc all in one computers are desktop computers that have all of the computer inner mechanisms in the same case as the monitor apple has made several popular examples of all in one computers such as the original macintosh of the mid and the imac of the late and common uses of home computers playing computer games writing solving mathematics looking for things on the internet watching tv and movies listening to music communicating with other people downloading sending mail using internet recording calculating editing video photo taking pictures photography drawing common uses of work computers word processing spreadsheets excel powerpoint presentations photo editing photoshop gimp mail video editing rendering encoding audio recording system management working methods computers store data and the instructions as numbers because computers can do things with numbers very quickly these data are stored as binary symbols and or symbol stored by computer is called bit which comes from the words binary digit computers can use many bits together to represent instructions and the data that these instructions use list of instructions is called program and is stored on the computer hard disk computers work through the program by using central processing unit and they use fast memory called ram as space to store the instructions and data while they are doing this when the computer wants to store the results of the program for later it uses the hard disk because things stored on hard disk can still be remembered after the computer is turned off an operating system tells the computer how to understand what jobs it has to do how to do these jobs and how to tell people the results millions of computers may be using the same operating system while each computer can have its own application programs to do what its user needs using the same operating systems makes it easy to learn how to use computers for new things user who needs to use computer for something different can learn how to use new application program some operating systems can have simple command lines or fully user frendly gui the internet one of the most important jobs that computers do for people is helping with communication communication is how people share information computers have helped people move forward in science medicine business and learning because they let experts from anywhere in the world work with each other and share information they also let other people communicate with each other do their jobs almost anywhere learn about almost anything or share their opinions with each other the internet is the thing that lets people communicate between their computers computers and waste computer is now almost always an electronic device it usually contains materials that will become electronic waste when discarded when new computer is bought in some places laws require that the cost of its waste management must also be paid for this is called product stewardship computers can become obsolete quickly depending on what programs the user runs very often they are thrown away within two or three years because newer programs require more powerful computer this makes the problem worse so computer recycling happens lot many projects try to send working computers to developing nations so they can be re used and will not become waste as quickly as most people do not need to run new programs some computer parts such as hard drives can break easily when these parts end up in the landfill they can put poisonous chemicals like lead into the ground water hard drives can also contain secret information like credit card numbers if the hard drive is not erased before being thrown away an identity thief can get the information from the hard drive even if the drive doesn work and use it to steal money from the previous owner bank account main hardware computers come in different forms but most of them have common design all computers have cpu all computers have some kind of data bus which lets them get inputs or output things to the environment all computers have some form of memory these are usually chips integrated circuits which can hold information many computers have some kind of sensors which lets them get input from their environment many computers have some kind of display device which lets them show output they may also have other peripheral devices connected computer has several main parts when comparing computer to human body the cpu is like brain it does most of the thinking and tells the rest of the computer how to work the cpu is on the motherboard which is like the skeleton it provides the basis for where the other parts go and carries the nerves that connect them to each other and the cpu the motherboard is connected to power supply which provides electricity to the entire computer the various drives cd drive floppy drive and on many newer computers usb flash drive act like eyes ears and fingers and allow the computer to read different types of storage in the same way that human can read different types of books the hard drive is like human memory and keeps track of all the data stored on the computer most computers have sound card or another method of making sound which is like vocal cords or voice box connected to the sound card are speakers which are like mouth and are where the sound comes out computers might also have graphics card which helps the computer to create visual effects such as environments or more realistic colors and more powerful graphics cards can make more realistic or more advanced images in the same way well trained artist can largest computer companies company

of the world oldest writing systems and the oldest in use today and is viewed as the source of many major inventions origins the first recorded use of the word china is dated it is derived from chīnī

the areas of political system philosophy religion art writing and literature china is home to some of the oldest artwork in the world statues and pottery as well as decorations made of jade are some classic examples before the qin dynasty united china there were hundreds of small states that fought each other for hundreds of years in war to control china this is known as the warring states period although the continuing wars made people suffer it was at this time when many great philosophies were born including confucianism and daoism confucianism and daoism alone have been the foundation of many social values seen in modern eastern asian cultures today its geography mostly looked like that of modern china except with northern and western edges that varied it was often attacked by northern nomadic people such as the turkic peoples and the mongols led by genghis khan and kublai khan during the history of ancient china the northern nomadic people and the chinese people had been fighting each other and taking turns to rule the land and the people of china however when the northern people beat the chinese people and came to rule the kingdom they also incorporated the chinese way of living and became like the chinese many of the strongest dynasties of china were ruled by the northern people including the qin tang yuan mongolian and qing each time they also brought new elements into the chinese culture new age the city of jinan while china achieved many things in the first millennium and early nd millennium it became an isolationist country in the th century this was because spain found enormous silver in the new continent which was the main currency money in china and europe at the time and china did not want to be bought by the foreigners by the time of the renaissance european powers started to take over other countries in asia while china was never actually taken over many european countries such as britain and france built spheres of influence in china since china had cut itself off from the world over the previous few centuries by the qing dynasty it had fallen behind other countries in technology and was helpless to stop this from happening

war later started between the kuomintang nationalists of the republic of china roc and the communists of the people republic of china prc the communists wanted to make china like the soviet union whereas the other side wanted to keep china in its current state at the time the communists were led by mao zedong liu shaoqi and others later liu lost influence with mao and his death to this day remains unresolved the communists eventually won the war the nationalists led by chiang kai shek fled to the island of taiwan and set up their new capital city in taipei after the chinese civil war the communist leader mao zedong declared new country the people republic of china prc in beijing on september this was followed by large celebration in tiananmen square on october which became the new country first national day under mao the country stayed poor while taiwan became richer his attempt at and with the great leap forward led to the deaths of many people from famine the cultural revolution caused great social upheaval after china underwent market economy reforms under deng xiaoping and experienced rapid economic growth china is now one of the largest economies in the world

the cathars are expelled from carcassonne in the year the lower older part of castle peyrepertuse this castle was one of the last cathar strongholds to fall the cathar faith was version of christianity they were usually considered gnostics the word cathar comes the greek word katharos meaning unpolluted from tobias churton the gnostics or the pure ones principles the cathars believed that the world had been made by bad god they believed that this bad god had taken them from the good god and put them in the world but inside their bodies there was spirit and that spirit needed to return to the good god they were famous for belief in form of reincarnation and believed that when someone died the bad god would put that person spirit in new body they believed this cycle of coming back to life could be escaped by ritual cleansing they were opposed to the doctrine of sin women were prominent in the faith they were pacifists they didn eat anything that was made from other animals including meat and cows milk the only exception to this was fish fish was ok to eat because they believed fishes were not alive but just things that were sometimes produced from dirt and water they preached tolerance of other faiths they rejected the usual christian rules of marriage and only believed in the new testament an earlier th century bulgarian heresy bogomilism and also manichaeism started some of these trends language they used bible in the language people spoke many other christians used bible in latin latin was spoken only by the priests problems in open challenge to catholic dominance began in about the first cathars said that the church was full of ravening starving wolves and hypocrites and worshipping the wrong god right in front of the most powerful catholics in the council of oxford in england wiped out the english cathars it was also suppressed in northern france in cathar bishops met to discuss organizing counter church in the south of france the languedoc nobles protected it and many noble women became perfects parish clergy had low morale or confidence reactions the catholic church was against catharism seeing it as heresy in the south of france there was tremendous religious fervor and an economy that was starting to grow and social class of merchants and peasants was starting to grow peasants owned their own land meanwhile in other parts of europe peasants were forced to give up their land to nobles and become serfs or slaves the system of feudalism there was strong central absolute monarchy that did not exist in the south of france the burghers and bankers had more power in this looser system moore is historian who believes that it was desire to crush this system and take over the land that drove the attack however there was real cultural and religious difference to cause problems troubadors who combined some of the traditions of the bards of the celts and jews were both part of the multicultural society in the south of france their influences were not appreciated by local or roman church figures the th century roman catholic monks were founding their monasteries outside the towns drawing the best people there results the cathars thus had little competition the cathar perfects the so called good men or good women lived restrained lives and spread their faith in towns where the catholics in general did not have their best agents also cathars preached that only these good leaders had to follow the regimens their whole lives lay people could repent only on their deathbeds many th century christian sects have similar beliefs the albigensian crusade methods the pope ordered crusade against the cathars in southern france he said any crusader who answered the call would be given the same rewards as crusader who went to the holy land this was an absolution of all sin in the launguedoc on the nd of july force of about crusaders arrived at the walls of beziers bearing the cross pattee to mislead and create ease among the cathars thinking they were friend not foe and demanded that about cathars be surrendered the people of the town who were mostly catholic said that rather than turn over their friends and family we would rather be flayed alive mistake by the defenders of beziers let thousands of attackers in arnauld amaury made the famous quote kill them all god knows his own on being asked how to tell who were cathars during the assault everyone in the town was killed some while taking refuge in the church it is guessed that were killed many of whom were catholics and not cathars at all the crusade became known as the albigensian crusade after the town of albi it was to wipe out the cathars almost entirely over forty or so years the crusaders wanted to go home but were ordered by the pope to continue until the whole south of france was controlled and all cathars were dead in they attacked the fortress at minerv and built the first great bonfire of heretics beginning the practice of burning at the stake that would continue in the inquisition of the counter reformation it is interesting to note that at the siege of montsegur when the fires were lit the cathars ran down the hill and threw themselves on as their beliefs were very strong result catharism disappeared from the northern italian cities after the pressured by the inquisition the last known cathar perfectus in the languedoc guillaume bélibaste was killed in other websites http dannyreviews com cathars html http faithweb com mont html http www fordham edu halsall source gui cathars html http philtar ucsm ac uk

church in ethiopia church is building that was constructed to allow people to meet to worship together these people are usually christians or influenced by christianity some other religious groups also call their religious buildings churches depending on the number of people that are in community the churches come in different sizes small churches are called chapels the churches in particular geographical area form group called the diocese each diocese has cathedral in most cases the cathedral is very big church cathedrals are the seat of bishops history of church buildings an old english church showing saxon architecture rounded end aberlady church near edinburgh scotland small church in ohio lindenberg church near berlin germany is th century church inside the transept of the cathedral of évora portugal speyer cathedral the largest romanesque building still in existence la madeleine paris is one of the main sights in paris france in the early days of christianity people had to worship in secret christian worship was not allowed in the roman empire so christians had to meet in secret place sometimes they met in people houses or barns sometimes they met underground the first places that were built for christian worship were small chapels that were cut into rock where people could worship without being discovered after the death of the roman emperor constantine in christians were allowed to have buildings to worship in these first churches were built on similar plan to roman basilicas this plan was later used for the fine gothic cathedrals and churches that were built at the end of the middle ages the parts of church there are several parts in the architecture of church not all churches will have all these parts the nave is the main part of the church where the congregation the people who come to worship sit the aisles are the sides of the church which may run along the side of the nave the transept if there is one is an area which crosses the nave near the top of the church this makes the church shaped like cross which is symbol of jesus death on cross the chancel leads up to the altar at the top of the church the altar is in the sanctuary the word sanctuary means sacred place people were not allowed to be arrested in the sanctuary so they were safe the altar is usually at the east end of the church people in the church sit facing the altar we say that the church faces east churches will also have tower or steeple usually at the west end if the church has transept the tower may be above the centre of the transept in roman catholic churches there is always stoup bowl of holy water near the entrance of the church this tradition comes from the fact that roman basilicas had fountain for washing in front of the entrance the font is bowl where people often babies are baptized this is also near the entrance of the church this is symbol of the fact that it is welcoming the people into the christian church traditionally the nave has long benches for the congregation to sit on these are called pews some churches may now have replaced their pews with chairs so that they can be moved about for different occasions at the front of the nave is the pulpit where the priest preaches these talks are called sermons there is also lectern like large music stand from where the lessons the bible readings are read if there are aisles along the side of the nave there will be pillars which hold up the roof in large churches or cathedrals there may be row of little arches along the top of these pillars this is called the triforium over the triforium is the clerestory which is row of windows high up in the church wall the chancel is the most holy part of the church and this is why it is often separated from the nave by screen which can be made of wood or stone or occasionally iron the congregation can see through the screen on the top of the screen there may be cross this is called rood pronounce like rude screen priests used to climb up staircase to the top of the rood screen to read the epistle and the gospel sometimes people sang from there inside the chancel are the benches where the choir sit these are called choir stalls they are on both sides the two sides of the choir sit facing one another the choir members who sit on the left north side are called cantoris the side where the cantor sits and those on the right south side are called decani the side where the deacon sits in some large churches or cathedrals the seats for the priests tip up the top of these seats when they are tipped up are called misericords from the latin word for mercy this is because the priests or monks were able to lean against them when they got tired if they had to stand up for long time sometimes there are holes in the walls of the screen so that the congregation can see through these are called squints if there is recess in the wall it is called an aumbry it is cupboard for communion wine that has been blessed by priest the altar may be right at the east end of the church but in larger churches or cathedrals it is often much farther forward in that case the very east end is called an apse sometimes it is separate chapel called the lady chapel churches through the ages the design of churches changed lot during the course of history often churches were made bigger when this happened there may be mixture of architectural styles these styles vary lot in different countries english churches in english churches there were several different periods of architecture the saxon period was time when churches were very simple the end of the church end of the sanctuary was often rounded hardly any are left now because they were mostly made of wood the norman period came from the style called romanesque which was popular in europe the arches had ornaments which were called mouldings the tops of the pillars looked like cushions so they were called cushion capitals the windows were narrow and rounded at the top early english or gothic architecture was not as solid and heavy as norman architecture towers were elegant and tall like the tower of salisbury cathedral the decorated style of architecture was popular at time when the plague black death was raging and third of the people in england died for that reason not so much building was done then there were lots of stone carvings were made in churches at that time the perpendicular style was very grand it had lots of straight upward lines and fan vaulting this can be seen in westminster abbey and king college chapel cambridge many churches that can be seen in england were built in this period in the churches were built in variety of styles often they copied some of the older styles after the great fire of london many new churches were built by the architect sir christopher wren they were built in the classical style churches continued to be built in later centuries like this but also the gothic style continued to be used modern churches often do not have the traditional cross shape it is difficult for the congregation to see and hear what is happening in the chancel modern churches bring the congregation choir and priests in closer touch an example is the round design for the church of christ the cornerstone in milton keynes modern churches are often simpler but with warmer character than the gothic churches many have beautiful mosaic glass windows coventry cathedral is famous example of modern church building related pages cathedral chapel choir music references encyclopædia britannica isbn other websites virtual

the medieval city of sienna with its town square and magnificent town hall modern suburb can be seen in the background city is place where many people live together city has many buildings and streets it has houses or apartments for many people to live shops where they may buy things places for people to work and government organisation to run the city and to keep law and order in the city people live in cities because it is easy for them to find and do the things they want there city usually has city centre where government and business take place and places called suburbs where people live around the outside of the centre definition tirana capital of albania there is no rule that is used all over the world to decide why some places are called city and other places are called town some things that make city are long history although many cities today have only been around for tens or hundreds of years there are few which have been so for thousands of years for example athens greece was founded in bc and rome italy has existed since bc large population cities can have millions of people living in and around them among them is tokyo japan and the tokyo metropolis around it which includes yokohama and chiba centre where business and government takes place the first case is often described as the financial capital such as frankfurt in germany the second case is true for different levels of government whether they are local or part of larger region for example atlanta georgia or an entire country for example washington cities which contain the government of the region it is in are called capitals almost every country has its own capital special powers called town privileges which have been given by the government of the country or its ruler this was done especially in europe during the middle ages having cathedral or university this rule is found in the united kingdom the smallest cathedral cities are st david and st asaph which are both in wales and ripon and wells which are in england in american english people often call all places where many people live cities see below size of cities size of cities the river thames is part of london transport system this picture shows the city of london tokyo is the world most populous metropolitan area the sizes of cities can be very different this depends on the type of city that it is cities that were built hundreds of years ago and which have not changed much are very much smaller than modern cities there are two main reasons one reason is that old cities often have city wall and most of the city is inside it another important reason is that the streets in old cities are often narrow if the city got too big it was hard for cart carrying food to get to the market place people in cities need food and the food always has to come from outside the city cities that were on river like london could grow much bigger than cities that were on mountain like sienna in italy because the river made transport route for carrying food and other goods as well as for transporting people london has been changing continually for hundreds of years while siena which was very important city in the has changed very little in years modern cities with modern transport systems can grow very large because the streets are wide enough for cars buses and trucks and there are often railway lines as well in the us the word city is often used for towns that are not very big when the first european people went to america they gave the name city to new places they hoped the places would be great cities in the future for example salt lake city was the name given to village of people when they started building the town they made street plans and called it great salt lake city for the nearby great salt lake now years later it really is big city in modern times many cities have grown bigger and bigger the whole area is often called metropolis and can sometimes includes several small ancient towns and villages the metropolis of london includes the city of london the city of westminster and many old villages such as notting hill southwark richmond greenwich and etc the part that is officially known as the city of london only takes up one square mile the rest is known as greater london many other cities have grown in the same way these giant cities can be exciting places to live and many people can find good jobs there but modern cities also have many problems many people cannot find jobs in the cities and have to get money by begging or by crime cars factories and waste create lot of pollution that makes people sick the smallest city is urban is an ancient city in france urban history is history of civilization the first cities were made in ancient times as soon as people began to create civilization famous ancient cities which fell to ruins included babylon troy mycenae and mohenjo daro benares in northern india is one among the ancient cities which has history of more years other cities that have existed since ancient times are athens in greece rome and volterra in italy alexandria in egypt and york in england in europe in the middle ages being city was special privilege granted by nobility cities that fall into this category usually had or still have city walls the people who lived in the city were privileged over those who did not medieval cities that still have walls include carcassonne in france tehran in iran toledo in spain and canterbury in england in the united kingdom city is town which people have always called city or which has got the name city status by royal charter special paper from the king or queen cities usually get this because they have special number of people or are important in the past cities got that name if they had cathedral or university some cathedral cities for example st david are small and people do not normally think of them as cities cities that became cities because of their university generally grow because more people move there to be educated at the university colleges the university cities of oxford and cambridge are famous throughout the world the largest city is shanghai while the fastest growing is dubai the smallest city in the uk is wells world largest cities in rio de janeiro city famous for its beauty large slums lie between the richest districts many of the world large cities have areas of

would help you understand related formulas like how much money you have in total and whether you are getting more money or less than you used to all these formulas are functions of time and so that is one way to think of calculus studying functions of time there are two different types of calculus differential calculus divides things into small different pieces and tells us how they change from one moment to the next while integral calculus joins integrates the small pieces together and tells us how much of something is made overall by series of changes calculus is used in many different areas of study such as physics astronomy biology engineering economics medicine and sociology history in the and sir isaac newton in england and gottfried leibniz in germany figured out calculus at the same time working separately from each other newton wanted to have new way to predict where to see planets in the sky because astronomy had always been popular and useful form of science and knowing more about the motions of the objects in the night sky was important for navigation of ships leibniz wanted to measure the space area under curve line which is not straight many years later the two men argued over who discovered it first scientists from england supported newton but scientists from the rest of europe supported leibniz most mathematicians today agree that both men share the credit equally some parts of modern calculus come from newton such as its uses in physics other parts come from leibniz such as the symbols used to write it they were not the first people to use mathematics to describe the physical world aristotle and pythagoras came earlier and so did galileo who said that mathematics was the language of science but they were the first to design system that describes how things change over time and can predict how they will change in the future the name calculus was the latin word for small stone the ancient romans used in counting and gambling the english word calculate comes from the same latin word differential calculus differential calculus is the process of finding out the rate of change of variable compared to another variable it can be used to find the speed of moving object or the slope of curve figure out the maximum or minimum points of curve or find answers to problems in the electricity and magnetism areas of physics among many other uses many amounts can be variables which can change their value unlike numbers such as or some examples of variables are distance and time the speed of an object is how far it travels in particular time so if town is kilometres miles away and person in car gets there in one hour they have traveled at an average speed of kilometres miles per hour but this is only an average they may have been traveling faster at some times on highway and slower at others at traffic light or on small street where people live imagine driver trying to figure out car speed using only its odometer distance meter and clock without speedometer until calculus was invented the only way to work this out was to cut the time into smaller and smaller pieces so the average speed over the smaller time would get closer and closer to the actual speed at point in time this was very long and hard process and had to be done each time people wanted to work something out tangents to the curve very similar problem is to find the slope how steep it is at any point on curve the slope of straight line is easy to work out it is simply how much it goes up or vertical divided by how much it goes across or horizontal on curve though the slope is variable has different values at different points because the line bends but if the curve was to be cut into very very small pieces the curve at the point would look almost like very short straight line so to work out its slope straight line can be drawn through the point with the same slope as the curve at that point if it is done exactly right the straight line will have the same slope as the curve and is called tangent but there is no way to know without very complicated mathematics whether the tangent is exactly right and our eyes are not accurate enough to be certain whether it is exact or simply very close what newton and leibniz found was way to work out the slope or the speed in the distance example exactly using simple and logical rules they divided the curve into an infinite number of very small pieces they then chose points on either side of the range they were interested in and worked out tangents at each as the points moved closer together towards the point they were interested in the slope approached particular value as the tangents approached the real slope of the curve they said that this particular value it approached was the actual slope picture that shows what and mean on the curve let say we have function is short for function so this equation means is function of this tells us that how high is on the vertical axis depends on what the horizontal axis is at that time for example with the equation we know that if is then will be if is then will be if is then will be if we use x² the derivative produced using this method is or multiplied by so we know without having to draw any tangent lines that at any point on the curve the derivative marked with the prime symbol will be at any point this process of working out slope using limits is called differentiation or finding the derivative leibniz came to the same result but called dx which means with respect to he called the resulting change in dy which means tiny amount of leibniz notation is used by more books because it is easy to understand when the equations become more complicated in leibniz notation mathematicians have grown this basic theory to make simple algebra rules which can be used to find the derivative of almost any function main idea of calculus the main idea in calculus is called the fundamental theorem of calculus this main idea says that the two calculus processes differential and integral calculus are opposites that is person can use differential calculus to undo an integral calculus process also person can use integral calculus to undo differential calculus method this is just like using division to undo multiplication or addition to undo subtraction in single sentence the fundamental theorem runs something like this the derivative of the integral of function is the function itself demonstration of main idea of calculus how to use integral calculus to find areas integration can be thought of as way of finding the area under curve we can approximate the area under curve by adding up the areas of many rectangles underneath the curve the more rectangles we use the better our approximation the method integral calculus uses to find areas of shapes is to break the shape up into many small boxes and add up the area of each of the boxes this gives an approximation to the area if the boxes are made narrower and narrower then there are more and more of them and the area of all the boxes becomes very close to the area of the shape one of the main ideas of calculus is that we can imagine having an infinite number of these boxes each infinitely narrow and then we would have the exact area of the shape other uses of calculus calculus is used to describe things that change like things in nature it can be used for showing and learning all of these how waves move waves are very important in the natural world for example sound and light can be thought of as waves where heat moves like in house this is useful for architecture building houses so that the house can be as cheap to heat as possible how very small things like atoms act how fast something will fall also known as gravity how machines work also known as mechanics the path of the moon as it moves around the earth also the path of the earth as it moves around the sun and any planet or moon moving around anything in space
th century french coin coin is normally round piece of metal that is used as currency or money coins have been made for about years the first place to make coins was lydia modern turkey these coins were made of precious metals and allowed people to trade with standard amount of metal most people use coins as currency they usually have lower value than banknotes appearance many coins have unique or complicated decorations one side often has the picture of famous or important person head on it the different decorations on each side of coin might be used to decide things randomly this is called tossing coin person can throw the coin into the air and catch it you then look at which side is facing up if the head is facing up it is called heads if the other side is facing up it is called tails before tossing the coin someone has to decide what each side means tossing coin can be type of gambling which is illegal against the law in some countries other views some people see coins as sign of greed such as some communists and puritans who sometimes condemn over hoarding of coins and ascetics who often keep little in the ways of money coins leading poor lifestyle collecting because coins have been made for very long time some people collect old coins they can be much cheaper than other old things especially if they are made of cheap metals like copper older coins normally cost more than newer ones but rarity matters more some coins from the cost vast sums while some roman coins cost very little references

cuba is an island country in the caribbean sea the country is made up of the big island of cuba the isla de la juventud island isle of youth and many smaller islands havana is the capital of cuba it is the largest city the second largest city is santiago de cuba in spanish the capital is called la habana cuba is near the united states mexico haiti jamaica and the bahamas people from cuba are called cubans the official language is spanish cuba is warm all year in christopher columbus landed on the island of cuba he claimed it for the kingdom of spain cuba became spanish colony until the spanish american war of after the war it was part of the united states it gained independence in in guerilla fighters led by fidel castro and che guevara overthrew cuba dictator fulgencio batista in what became the cuban revolution castro began making relations with the soviet union and tried to close lot of american businesses in cuba the united states did not like this in castro officially announced that his government was socialist the us attempted to invade cuba to regain control of it and overthrow it communist led government but failed the communist party of cuba was created in and has ruled the island ever since today cuba is the only communist state outside of asia in the caribbean and in the western hemisphere culture cuba is famous for many types of music especially dance music such as the salsa and mambo because cubans have ancestors from spain africa south america and north america cuban music is special and different reading is very popular in cuba many people especially enjoy reading books or things that come from outside the country even though the government does not approve of this they also love music and sports cuban music is very lively this is because lot of it comes from african and spanish rhythms baseball basketball and athletics events are loved by many cuban people the cuban football team took at one football world cup part in they reached the quarter final and lost against sweden history early history map of cuba in before cuba was conquered by the spaniards three tribes lived on the island they were the taínos the ciboneys and the guanajatabeyes the taínos were the largest and most common of the three tribes they farmed crops such as beans corn squash and yams the taínos also slept in hammocks which the spaniards would introduce to the rest of the world then in christopher columbus arrived in cuba on his first trip to the americas three years later he claimed the islands for the spanish the spanish began to rule cuba afterwards the spanish brought thousands of slaves from africa to cuba to work for them most of the native cubans died because of the new diseases brought by the spanish and africans the spanish also treated the native cubans very cruelly and massacred many of them the spanish ruled for many years cuba became the most important producer of sugar in the early cubans rebelled against the spanish rulers but failed until when the united states went to war with the spanish and defeated them cuba became american for four years afterwards before it became an independent republic in even though cuba was independent the americans still controlled the island by law called the platt amendment in the cubans stopped the platt amendment but the americans still had big say in cuban politics americans owned most of cuba businesses the americans supported the leader fulgencio batista who was seen by many cubans as corrupt cuban revolution in fidel castro led revolution against fulgencio batista castro took power in cuba with che guevara from argentina his brother raul and others who fought against batista castro made many changes to cuba he ended american ownership of cuban businesses this made castro unpopular in america and the united states banned all contact with cuba many cubans went to america because of this in the americans helped some of these cubans to attack cuba and try to remove castro but they failed castro then asked the soviet union to help defend them from the americans which they did the soviet union put nuclear weapons in cuba and aimed them at the united states american president kennedy demanded that they be removed or new war would begin this was known as the cuban missile crisis the soviet union removed the missiles when the united states agreed to not continue attacking cuba and to remove missiles from turkey cuba became communist led country like the soviet union after this the soviet union bought most of cuba sugar for expensive prices cuba spent this money on health education and the army this made cuba schools and hospitals some of the best in the world the army fought in africa to support black africans against the white south african army cuba also supported groups in south america fighting against the dictators of those countries however the cuban government began to control most of life in cuba under the communist system disagreeing with the cuban government and fidel castro in public was not allowed some cubans did not like this and tried to leave cuba most cubans who left went to the united states some cubans who did not like the government and stayed were put in jail many groups from around the world protested against cuba because of this and demanded that fidel castro give up power in the soviet union collapsed this meant that cuba which had sold most of its products to the soviet union had no money coming into the country the americans made the restrictions against contact with cuba tighter america said the restrictions on contact would continue unless fidel castro gave up power cuba became very poor in the this became known in cuba as the special period because of the disaster cuba changed to allow less control by the government more discussion amongst the people and private shops and businesses cuba also tried to get tourists to visit the island in the tourism to cuba began to make money for the island again though fidel castro had remained in power he had passed all duties to his brother raul after an illness fidel castro was one of the longest serving heads of state in raúl castro became the official president of cuba in april historic talks took place with us president obama and cuban general secretary raúl castro in improving relations between the two nations the trade embargo issued by president kennedy in the has been considerably loosened under obama administration us citizens can now travel directly to cuba at certain times of the year before americans had to go via mexico if they wanted to go to cuba americans are still not allowed to purchase or smoke cuban cigars the cigars are smuggled over the us canadian border since they are legal in canada for military service men from the age of to years old must go into the army for two years it is optional for women demographics the population of cuba is close to million the people of cuba come from three different groups the largest group is the descendants of the spanish settlers who came to cuba the smallest group is the descendants of the black african slaves who were brought in to do the work and birth children in the barracoon as new world slaves who could be legally sold into life time bondage in the united states the middle sized group is mix of african and spanish the government succeeded in seeing that the three different groups were treated the same according to dna caribbean studies institute the racial makeup of the population of cuba is european cubans descend from settlers that came during the very late th century and onward most white cubans came from many different parts of spain but the most numerous were the canary islanders andalusians and catalans there was as well some french italian and english peoples whites makeup approximately of cuba population as of and they mostly populate the west part of cuba specially cities like havana and pinar del rio these brought with them their language religions music and others africans and mulatto cubans descend from the arrival of african slaves that came from various parts of africa but the most numerous were west africans there were also more than haitians that came to cuba during the haitian revolution days most cuban slaves tended to come from the kongo and yoruba tribes there were also the igbos ewes fons fulas mandinkas and some others afro cubans range enormously from percent to percent of the population and they are mostly concentrated in the east parts of cuba these brought with them their instruments reigion santeria and customs to the cuban culture mediterranean cubans are about of the population however one must know that lot of the southern spaniard cuban descendants have good portion of moor blood in their family lines due to the close proximate spain is to north africa many mediterranean cubans came during the and sometimes onward these are most concentrated in the east specially cities like guantanamo bay they brought much of their foods and cuisines to cuba and few vocabularies health and education cuba is developing country and is often depicted as very poor country in some aspects however like education health care and life expectancy it ranks much better than most countries in latin america its infant death rate is lower than some developed countries the average life expectancy is years all the children are required to go to school from six to twelve years old and nearly everybody is able to read and write at least there is free education at every level because of this cuba has literacy rate in the world food programme certified cuba to be the only country in this region without undernourished children in the same year the united nations said that cuba was the only nation in the world that met the world wide fund for nature definition of sustainable development geography tobacco field in pinar del río cuba is the largest island in the west indies it has many resources only about one fourth of the land is mountains or hills much of the land is gentle hills or plains which are good for farming or raising cattle cuba has fertile soil and warm climate that makes it great for growing crops sugar is the most important crop of cuba and they may get it from the sugar cane sugar cane is the largest cash crop grown in cuba and it brings in most of the money after that the second is tobacco tobacco is made into cigars by hand hand made cigar is considered by many people to be the finest in the world other important crops are rice coffee and fruit cuba also has many minerals cobalt nickel iron copper and manganese are all on the island salt petroleum and natural gas are there too the coast of cuba has many bays and few good harbors havana which is the capital is also port other harbors have port cities nuevitas is port city on the north coast cienfuegos guantánamo and santiago de cubaare some of the port cities on the south coast cuba has semi tropical climate that means that the cool ocean winds keep it becoming hot despite its being in the tropiocal zone cuba has wet season and dry season the dry season is from november to april and the wet season is from may to october august to october is also the hurricane season in the atlantic ocean because of this most of cuba port cities can be flooded along the coast

the human skull is often used as symbol for death death is the end of life in an organism all biological and living activity of the living thing stop including the mind and the senses the usual signal for death is that the heart stops beating and cannot be restarted this can be caused by many things all living things have limited lifespan and all living things eventually die living things which have died are normally described as being dead death of humans is often investigated for the cause in case of crime such as murder or disease that may continue to kill other humans about people die every day around the world about two thirds of these people die because of age in addition to the physical body some believe humans also have soul and believe that the soul can continue without body afterlife move into another body reincarnation or cease to exist annihilationism religions have different beliefs about this issue many cultures have their own customs and rituals to respect the dead when people talk about things or events that lead to the death of plant or animal those things or events are usually described as being deadly or fatal in the case of diseases they are described as terminal humans are no different from any other lifeform our bodies have an ability for self repair but that ability is limited finding the cause of death is medical speciality called pathology in medicine death is when the heart stops beating for more than several minutes there are special times in which people recover even though the heart has stopped for minutes such as near drowning in very cold water if machines are used to help the heart and lungs work then the moment of death is more difficult to know society and culture mummified either naturally or by intention death is commonly sad or unpleasant thing to people it can make people think about their own death people might miss or be sad for the person who has died they might also be sad for the family and friends of the person who has died in any society human death is surrounded by ritual wake or funeral is normal in some places it was common to eat the dead in form of ritual cannibalism but this is no longer common in part because disease like kuru can be passed this way human dead bodies are taboo in most societies and must be handled in special ways for combination of religious and hygiene reasons human dead body must always be reported in law to be sure it is disposed of properly dealing with dead bodies and their property finding the cause of any human death and stopping similar death from happening to someone else are the main reasons people look into human morbidity or let dead bodies be cut open and looked at in an autopsy some religions do not allow autopsies because they feel the body is holy autopsies are usually required by the state if someone dies and people do not know why the autopsy helps find out if someone killed the person on purpose tried to hurt them or if they died from sickness to prepare for their own death humans can write last will and testament to be clear about who gets their property and possessions person will sometimes also volunteer to be an organ donor this might mean giving the whole body to medical research it can also save the lives of others by making organ transplants possible religious views of death for long time many people have been afraid of death and lot of people have wondered about what may happen to people after they die this is one of the largest questions of philosophy and religion many people believe there is some form of afterlife ancient rulers sometimes did insist not only that their own bodies and much property but even their servants and relatives be destroyed at their funeral in india this ritual still does sometimes occur old women sometimes carry guns in case their husband relatives come to throw them on the funeral fire christianity has special focus on death because of the state killing of jesus christ by the romans in islam this is thought to demonstrate the injustice of human systems of dealing out death and the ability of the best people to overcome it and even forgive it in christianity itself it is thought to prove that jesus himself was really god and so could lose his body and still have the power of resurrection in buddhism reincarnation is believed to occur reincarnation is an idea taken from hinduism confucianism advises respect for parents and forms of ancestor worship to respect both dead and living ancestors rituals surrounding death every ethical tradition including the medical view of the body has some ritual surrounding death often these excuse behaviours that might be hated if they did not have the ritual for instance one may say that organ transplant is like cannibalism very much of what happens at human death is ritual people who wish theirs to be dealt with certain way and who wish particular treatment like cremation of their body should decide in advance and set up the necessary payments and agreements this makes it much easier for their family after they die since there is no longer the ability to clearly communicate the wish for the same reason saying goodbye is important most of the stress of death seems to come for loved ones who did not have chance to say goodbye maybe it is to relieve this stress that rituals are created and to bring together those that knew someone so that the personal experience person can no longer communicate for themselves can be exchanged by others some ritual such as seances claim to allow people to speak to the dead this is not claimed to be very reliable both by scientists and even by those who do them very often preparing for death aside from wills goodbyes organ donations and funerals there is important personal experience to decide to pass on or not when someone knows they may soon die palliative care focuses on basic decisions people make when they are very close to the end of their lives and it ensures someone is always available to talk to them it is replacement for heroic medical intervention that may keep them physically alive but with no quality of life human psychology must prepare for death if it is anything other than quick surprise elizabeth kubler ross wrote that there were several stages in dying of which denial was the first and acceptance was the last recording one life is often something people with acceptance will do to leave memoir or full autobiography because events leave living memory and may only be part of oral tradition there are projects to record everything that people remember about world war and the shoah the first of these was to record everything remembered about the civil war this discipline has changed history since we have so many more first person accounts of the times and made social history much more standard other terms for death there are other terms for death examples are to pass away to go to better place to buy the farm generally used in the military to leave the earth and to kick the bucket the term gone may also be term for describing death for example if person has died they are also said to be gone as in gone to better place or no

diesel electric engine is diesel generator diesel engine that drives an electric generator the generator feeds electric power to an electric motor which turns driveshaft its efficiency is higher than when an engine drives shaft through gears most locomotives and many ships use diesel electric drive many diesel electric drives especially small ones store the electricity in battery some designs also store braking energy in flywheel which can also charge battery however these add even more complexity and weight to the vehicle so are more appropriate for city driving where service stations are always available and there is much stop and go driving because they do not require any change or investment in stations nor much in vehicle design diesel electric vehicles are believed to be the most likely replacement for today internal combustion engine when properly tuned they have low emissions and they use only about one third of the fossil fuel of most gasoline engines powering similar vehicles honda and toyota are presently delivering consumer priced diesel electric cars by contrast hydrogen infrastructure is thought to be decades off and is not fully implemented even in iceland where there is abundant free geothermal electricity many activists feel that promoting hydrogen is stall way to avoid forcing the shift to diesel electric vehicles in the nearer term

earth is the planet we live on it is the third planet from the sun it is the only planet known to have life on it lots of scientists think the earth formed around billion years ago it is one of four rocky planets on the inside of the solar system the other three are mercury venus and mars the large mass of the sun makes earth move around it just as the mass of earth makes the moon move around it earth also turns around in space so that different parts face the sun at different times earth goes around the sun once one year for every times it turns all the way around one day earth is the only planet in our solar system that has large amount of liquid water about of the surface of earth is covered by oceans because of this people some times called it blue planet because of its water earth is home to millions of species of plants and animals the things that live on earth have changed its surface greatly for example early cyanobacteria changed the air and gave it oxygen the living part of earth surface is called the biosphere orbit and turning earth turns at an angle an axial tilt in relation to its path around the sun earth is part of the eight planets and many thousands of small bodies that move around the sun as its solar system the solar system is moving through the orion arm of the milky way galaxy now and will be for about the next years earth is generally away from the sun this distance is named an astronomical unit earth moves along its way at an average speed of about second earth turns all the way around about times in the time it takes for earth to go all the way around the sun to make up this extra bit of day every year an additional day is used every four years this is named leap year the moon goes around earth at an average distance of it is locked to earth so that it always has the same half facing earth the other half is called the dark side of the moon it takes about days for the moon to go all the way around earth but because earth is moving around the sun at the same time it takes about days for the moon to go from dark to bright to dark again this is where the word month came from even though most months now have or days history of earth earth and the other planets formed about billion years ago they were made of the leftover gas from the nebula that made the sun the moon may have been formed after collision between the early earth and smaller planet sometimes called theia scientists believe that parts of both planets broke off becoming by gravity the moon earth water came from different places condensing water vapour and comets and asteroids hitting earth made the oceans within billion years that is at about billion years ago the first life evolved in the archaean era some bacteria developed photosynthesis which lets plants make food from the sun light and water this released lot of oxygen which was first taken up by iron in solution eventually free oxygen got into the atmosphere or air making earth surface suitable for aerobic life see great oxygenation event this oxygen also formed the ozone layer which protects earth surface from bad ultraviolet radiation from the sun complex life on the surface of the land did not exist before the ozone layer earth was very different in the distant past long ago almost all land was in one place this is called supercontinent the earliest known supercontinent was called vaalbara much later there was time the cryogenian when earth was almost entirely covered by thick ice sheets glaciers this is called the snowball earth theory what it is made of size of earth compared with the other rocky planets in the solar system mercury venus and mars earth is rocky it is the largest of the rocky planets moving around the sun by mass and by size it is much smaller than the gas giants such as jupiter chemical make up overall earth is made of iron oxygen silicon magnesium sulfur nickel calcium and aluminium the left over is made of many different kinds of other chemicals chemicals that are very uncommon such as gold and platinum can be very valuable the structure of earth changes from the inside to the outside the center of earth earth core is mostly iron nickel sulfur and less than other things the earth crust is largely oxygen oxygen is normally gas but it can join with other chemicals to make compounds like water and rocks of rocks have oxygen in them the most common oxygen having rocks are silica made with silicon alumina made with aluminium rust made with iron lime made with calcium magnesia made with magnesium potash made with potassium and sodium oxide and there are others as well shape earth shape is spheroid not quite sphere because it is slightly squashed on the top and bottom the shape is called an oblate spheroid as earth spins around itself the centrifugal force forces the equator out little and pulls the poles in little the equator around the middle of earth surface is about long the highest mountain above sea level the well known mount everest which is above sea level is not actually the one that is the farthest away from the center of the earth instead the sleeping volcano mount chimborazo in ecuador is it is only above sea level but it is almost at the equator because of this mount chimborazo is from the center of the earth while mount everest is closer to it similarly the lowest point below sea level that we are conscious of is the challenger deep in the mariana trench in the pacific ocean it is about below sea level but again there are probably places at the bottom of the arctic ocean that are nearer to the center of the earth what it is like inside picture of the inside of the earth showing the different levels in fact the air and the outside levels are much thinner than shown here the deepest hole ever dug is only about we know something about the inside of the earth though because we can learn things from earthquakes and the times when volcanoes erupt we are able to see how quickly the shock waves move through earth in different places the inside of earth is very different from the outside almost all of earth liquid water is in the seas or close to the surface the surface also has lot of oxygen which comes from plants small and simple kinds of life can live far under the surface but animals and plants only live on the surface or in the seas the rocks on the surface of earth earth crust are well known they are thicker where there is land between thick under the seas they are sometimes only thick there are three groups of rocks that make up most of the earth crust some rock is made when the hot liquid rock comes from inside the earth igneous rocks another type of rock is made when sediment is laid down usually under the sea sedimentary rocks and third kind of rock is made when the other two are changed by very high temperature or pressure metamorphic rocks very few rocks also fall out of the sky meteorites below the crust is warm and almost liquid rock that is always moving around the earth mantle then there is thin liquid layer of heated rock the outer core this is very hot the middle of the inside of the earth would be liquid as well but all the weight of the rock above it pushes it back into being solid this solid middle part the inner core is almost all iron this is what makes the earth magnetic pieces of the crust form plates picture showing the earth largest and most important plates the earth crust is solid but made of parts which move very slowly the thin level of hard rock on the outside of the earth rests on hot liquid material below it in the deeper mantle this liquid material moves because it gets heat from the hot center of the earth the slow movement of the plates is what causes earthquakes volcanoes and large groups of mountains on the earth there are three ways plates can come together two plates can move towards each other convergent plate edges this can form islands such as japan volcanoes and high mountain ranges such as the andes and himalayas two plates can move away from each other divergent plate edges this gives the warm liquid rock inside the earth place to come out this makes special mountain ranges below the sea or large low lands like africa great rift valley plates are able to move beside each other as well transform plate edges such as the san andreas fault this makes their edges crush against each other and makes many shocks as they move surface the outside of the earth is not even there are high places called mountains and high flat places called plateaus there are low places called valleys and canyons for the most part moving air and water from the sky and seas damages rocks in high places and breaks them into small pieces the air and water then move these pieces to lower places because of this the earth would have been very flat long time before now the fundamental cause of the differences in the earth surface is plate tectonics all places on earth are made of or are on top of rocks the outside of the earth is usually not uncovered rock over of the earth is covered by seas full of salty water this salty water makes up about of all earth water the fresh water people can drink is mostly ice only very small amount is in rivers and under the earth for people to drink and use the air above the earth stops the water from going away into outer space also much of the land on earth is covered with plants or with what is left from earlier living things places with very little rain are dry wastes called deserts deserts usually have few living things but life is able to grow very quickly when these wastes have rainfall places with large amounts of rain may be large woods lately people have changed the environment of the earth great deal air all around the earth is large amount of air the atmosphere the mass of the earth pulls the gasses in the air down and does not let them go into outer space the air is mostly made of nitrogen about and oxygen about but there are few other gasses as well most living things need the air or parts of the air gripped in the water to breathe and live they use the gasses especially oxygen and carbon dioxide to make and use sugar and to give themselves power the air animals and plants use to live is only the first level of the air around the earth the troposphere the day to day changes in this level of air are named weather the changes between places far away from each other and from year to year are named the climate rain and storms are both in this level both come about because this part of the air gets colder as it goes up cold air becomes thicker and falls and warm air becomes thinner and goes up the turning earth moves the air as well and air moves north and south because the middle of the earth generally gets more power from the sun and is warmer than the north and south points at the same time air over water specially very warm water gets water in it but because cold air is not able to take in as much water it starts to make clouds and rain as it gets colder the way water moves around in circle like this is called the water cycle above this first level there are four other levels the air gets colder as it goes up in the first level in the second level the stratosphere the air gets warmer as it goes up this level has special kind of oxygen called ozone the ozone in this air keeps living things safe from damaging rays from the sun the power from these rays is what makes this level warmer and warmer the middle level the mesosphere gets colder and colder with height the fourth level the thermosphere gets warmer and warmer and the last level the exosphere is almost outer space and has very little air at all it reaches about half the way to the moon the three outer levels have lot of electric power moving through them this is called the ionosphere and is important for radio and other electric waves in the air it is also where the northern lights are even though air seems very light the weight of all of the air above the outside of the earth air pressure is important generally from sea level to the top of the outer level of the air space of air one square centimeter across has mass of about kg and space of air one square inch across has weight of about pounds the mass of the air also keeps the earth safe when rocks meteorites hit it from outer space without the air the damage meteorites do would be much greater because of the air meteorites generally burn up long before they get to the earth the air also keeps the earth warm specially the half turned away from the sun some gasses especially methane and carbon dioxide work like blanket to keep things warm in the past the earth has been much warmer and much colder than it is now since people have grown used to the heat we have now though we do not want the earth to be too much warmer or colder most of the ways people create electric power use burning kinds of carbon especially coal oil and natural gas burning these creates new carbon dioxide and can cause more warming large discussion is going on now about what people should do about the earth latest warming which has gone on for about years so far this warming has been good for people plants have grown better and the weather has been better than when it was colder before some people who learn about science though say that many bad things will possibly come about if the warming goes on people about seven billion people live on earth they live in about different lands called countries some like russia are large with many large cities others like the vatican are small the five countries with the most people are china india the united states indonesia and brazil about of people live in the north half of the world which has most of the land scientists think that people originally came from africa now of all people do not live in africa but in europe and asia people change the earth in many ways they have been able to grow plants for food and clothes for about ten thousand years when there was enough food they were able to build towns and cities near these places men and women were able to change rivers bring water to farms and stop floods rising water from coming over their land people found useful animals and bred them so they were easier to keep related pages age of the earth geology list of planets solar system structure of the earth

an experiment is test of an idea or method it is often used by scientists and engineers an experiment is used to see how well the idea matches the real world experiments have been used for many years to help people understand the world around them experiments are part of scientific method experiments can tell us if theory is false or if something does not work they cannot tell us if theory is true when einstein said that gravity could affect light it took few years before astronomers could test it general relativity predicts that the path of light is bent in gravitational field light passing massive body is deflected towards that body this effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the sun now hundred years or so after einstein published his ideas there have been many tests all of which have been consistent with einstein predictions but one day we might find the theory has some limits beyond which it does not work what we test are implications of the theory because the theory itself is too large and complicated to test all at once the universe does not tell us when we are right only when we are wrong karl popper famous experiments galileo galilei did some experiments about free fall benjamin franklin showed that lightning is form of electricity the michelson morley experiment proved flaw in old physics and prompted einstein work ivan pavlov did some experiments about the classical conditioning of dogs the avery macleod mccarty experiment proved dna was the molecule which caused heredity stanley milgram showed that people follow orders this became known as the milgram experiment references shadish william cook thomas campbell donald experimental and quasi experimental designs for generalized causal inference boston houghton mifflin isbn
ethics is the part of philosophy that deals with good and evil ethics tries to answer questions like what actions are good what actions are evil how can we tell the difference are good and evil the same how should we make hard decisions that might help or hurt other people how do our actions affect others ideas about ethics when discussing ethics the philosophy is generally separated into thinking about morality the involvement of science the freedom of people to decide for themselves how to act within their own beliefs morality is what someone thinks or feels is good or bad there are many different moralities but they share some things for example most people think that murder killing somebody is wrong compare exodus some philosophers have hope to find more things that moralities share they think that ethics should use the scientific method to study things that people think are good or bad their work can be used to test the fairness of situation such as how people should treat each other an example of this kind of thinking is the categorical imperative many countries have laws based on this idea of fairness what is ethics used for understanding ethics can help people decide what to do when they have choices many philosophers think that doing anything or making any choice is part of ethics ethics is part of other fields of study in many ways here are some ways ethics is part of the study of religion in religion people often learn what is good or bad from what they believe about god or gods some important ideas about what is good or bad have come from religion see ten commandments some theories of economics say ethics has to do with money money is big part of most people lives thinking about morality can be important in economics for example there is saying about ethics taken from the bible that the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil timothy the philosophy of marxism also says that few people using money in the wrong way can hurt many other people government policy can be affected by what politicians think is ethical politicians try to create laws that help everyone do what is right political debates happen when the people who make public policy do not agree about what is right in work thinking about ethics can help with hard questions work can be like both economics and politics workers have to make money and follow laws but the best way to do both is not always easy to know the study of this is called business ethics people like doctors and nurses have to make hard choices about how to care for people sometimes the person being cared for their family or the doctor do not agree what is best for them also choices have to be made if there is not enough money for all people to get the help they need the study of this is called medical ethics discussing ethics can also be way to stop people fighting or starting war by talking about ethics people hope to get what they want without being violent this works when all people agree that peace is very important but not everyone agrees about what is right or wrong so sometimes anger can make it hard to talk without fighting along with aesthetics ethics forms part of axiology the philosophy of what people like related pages conflict of interest utilitarianism the republic book by plato that says that people who have power should use ethics to make choices the prince book by niccolò machiavelli that says that people who have power should not use ethics to make choices
prime it means english prime is way of speaking english without using the verb to be in any way be is am are was were been and being instead an prime speaker or writer uses different verbs like to become to remain and to equal or they might choose to rearrange the sentence to show that the thing does not actually act for example in prime writer would change the statement mistakes were made to joe made mistakes this change in wording reveals an actor joe where the previous form concealed the actor users of prime would consider the changed sentence more accurate what prime is david bourland jr first suggested prime in bourland had studied the discipline way of thinking of general semantics the main idea of general semantics is that people can only know what they observe and experience when they see hear touch taste smell think and feel and furthermore that what they observe and experience can affect how they observe and experience in the future because each person has different experiences throughout their lives they interpret their experiences differently students of general semantics and users of prime contend that to say this cat is soft leaves out many other attributes and implies that the outside object of the cat is the same as the inside experience of softness instead prime users say this cat feels soft to me to remind themselves of the following that their experience of softness involves both the outside object called cat and the eyes hands brain and nervous system of the observer that someone else might experience different aspects of the cat that they themselves might experience something different at different time or in different circumstances the cat might scratch them or look or feel wet or matted with dirt what prime is not although languages like russian arabic turkish and cantonese do not always use separate verb for to be they do have the idea of being for example an english speaker might say this apple is red an arabic speaker might say this apple red most languages can be used to express the idea of red apple an prime user chooses to say this apple looks red to me to remind themselves that seeing red involves both the apple and the eye and brain of the person looking at the apple many teachers of english encourage students to use verbs other than to be to them using more active verbs makes writing clearer and more interesting these teachers want to improve their students writing and may not agree with the ideas of general semantics or prime different functions of to be in english to be can have different functions it talks about identity the cat is my only pet the cat is garfield it talks about belonging to class or group the cat is an animal it can talk about properties the cat is furry it can be an auxiliary verb the cat is sleeping the cat is bitten by the dog it can talk about existence there is cat it can talk about location the cat is here
electron microscope picture of the ebola virus ebola virus is very dangerous virus it belongs to the filoviridae family and is responsible for severe disease characterized by the sudden onset of hemorrhagic fever accompanied by other nonspecific signs and symptoms hemorrhagic means that the victim will bleed lot inside and outside their body the virus attacks almost every organ and tissue of the human body resulting in multi organ dysfunction out of every people who get ebola on average five to nine die there are four kinds of ebola virus that can cause the disease the virus was first found in sudan it is found in africa with very few cases in europe and the united states transmission left simple video explanation of ebola virus the ebola virus that makes people sick lives in the blood and other liquids and wet things in some kinds of non human animals without killing them scientists think the animals it lives in are mainly some kinds of monkeys or fruit bats when people touch animals that have the virus or wet things that came out of those animals they can get sick ebola cannot be caught through the air or by being near sick people the virus can only go from liquids into people bodies this means ebola can be caught by touching sick person blood saliva mucus semen diarrhea vomit or other fluids that come out of sick person body if person does not die from the disease he can still give other people the infection by having sex for nearly another two months after they stop being sick this is because the virus can still be in the man semen after long time once the virus enters the human body via mucosal surfaces abrasions or injuries in the skin or by direct parental transmission it fuses with the cells lining the respiratory tract eyes or body cavities it invades the macrophages and dendritic immune cells and releases its genetic content the cell explosion triggers the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines initiating cytokine storm the genetic material takes over the cell machinery to replicate itself new copies of the virus are formed and released into the system the virus then goes on to attack spleen kidneys and even the brain the blood vessels leak blood and fluid into the surrounding tissues this atypical clotting and bleeding at the same time manifests externally in the form of rashes the virus causes the shutdown of other vital organs such as liver and lungs too in fact it is able to invade almost all human cells through different attachment mechanisms for each cell type except for lymphocytes the very cells that are meant to fight infection are used as carriers to spread infection to other body parts it has been found that the ebola infected cells do not undergo normal apoptosis but exhibit vacuolization and signs of necrosis symptoms when people get ebola the first symptoms look like some other diseases people get fever and feel very tired their head stomach joints and throat might hurt sometimes people think they have other diseases like malaria or typhoid fever later people get much sicker they bleed both inside and outside their bodies they have blood in their diarrhea and vomit they bleed from their noses mouths and genitals sex organs they get shock low blood pressure fast pulse heart rate and low blood circulation to the body their organs might stop working ebola also causes stiffness throughout the body which makes it hard for sick people to move five to nine out of every ten people who get sick with ebola die treatment there is no cure for ebola but if people get care quickly from doctors and nurses at hospital more of them live people with ebola need lot of fluids to replace fluids lost from diarrhea vomiting and bleeding the most important care is giving them water with very small amount of salt and sugar in it this is called oral rehydration it helps to replace their fluids and blood it is also important to give medicines in case they get bad blood pressure and blood circulation prevention in december study found the vsv ebov vaccine to be very effective in the neighborhood of against the ebola virus making it the first vaccine against the disease many ebola vaccine candidates had been developed in the decade prior to but as of october none had yet been approved by the united states food and drug administration fda for use in humans research world community grid is computing project that is seeking possible drug treatments people donate the spare time on their computers to the project reference
ecology is the science which studies the biota the environment and their interactions it comes from the greek oikos house logos study ecology is the study of ecosystems ecosystems describe the web or network of relations among organisms at different scales of organization since ecology refers to any form of biodiversity ecologists research everything from tiny bacteria in nutrient recycling to the effects of tropical rain forests on the earth atmosphere scientists who study these interactions are called ecologists terrestrial ecoregion and climate change research are two areas where ecologists now focus there are many practical applications of ecology in conservation biology wetland management natural resource management agriculture forestry fisheries city planning urban ecology community health economics and applied science it provides framework for understanding and researching human social interaction ecology in politics ecology starts many powerful philosophical and political movements including the conservation movement wellness movement environmental movement and ecology movement we know today when these are combined with peace movements and the six principles they are called green movements in general these put ecosystem health first on list of human moral and political priorities as the way to achieve better human health and social harmony and better economics people with these beliefs are called political ecologists some have organized into the green parties but there are actually political ecologists in most political parties they very often use arguments from ecology to advance policy especially forest policy and energy policy also ecology means that it is the branch of biology dealing with the relations and interactions between organisms and their environment including other organisms ecology includes economics many ecologists also deal with human economics lynn margulis says that economics studies how humans make living while ecology studies how every other animal makes living mike nickerson says that economy is three fifths of ecology since ecosystems create resources and dispose of waste which the economy assumes is done for free ecological economics and human development theory try to separate the economic questions from others but it is difficult many people think economics is just part of ecology now and that economics that ignores it is wrong natural capital is an example of one theory combining both ecology and anthropology sometimes ecology is compared to anthropology anthropology includes how our bodies and minds are affected by our environment while ecology includes how our environment is affected by our bodies and minds there is even type of anthropology called ecological anthropology which studies how people interact with the environment antoine de saint exupery stated the earth teaches us more about ourselves than all the books because it resists us man discovers himself when he measures himself against the obstacle related pages sustainable development references
economists study how people make decisions such as those that occur in alt vegetable vendor in marketplace são paulo stock exchange buyers and sellers are not present themselves they use intermediaries and technology to trade most ideas about buying and selling are the same as in real market though economics is the social science which studies economic activity how people make choices to get what they want it has been defined as the study of scarcity and choice and is basically about individual choice it also studies what affects the production distribution and consumption of goods and services in an economy investment and income relate to economics the word comes from ancient greek and relates to οἶκος oíkos house and νόμος nomos custom or law the models used in economics today were mostly started in the th century people took ideas from the of political economy because they wanted to use an empirical approach similar to the one used in the natural sciences subjects and objects in economics the subjects actors in economic study are households business companies the government the state and foreign countries households offer their factors of production to companies this includes work land capital machines buildings and information they get income which they use to buy or consume goods business companies produce and sell goods and services and buy factors of production from households and from other companies the state or public sector includes institutions and organisations the state takes some of the earnings from the business companies and households and uses it to pay for public goods like streets or education to be available for everyone the last subject is foreign countries this includes all households business companies and state institutions which are not based in one own country they demand and supply goods from abroad the objects things acted upon in economic study are consumer goods capital goods and factors of production consumer goods are classified as usage goods for example gasoline or toilet paper as purpose goods for example house or bicycle and as services for example the work of doctor or cleaning lady capital goods are goods which are necessary for producing other goods examples of these are buildings equipment and machines factors of production are work ground capital information and environment general economic rules all people have to decide between their options the cost of goods is what person gives up for the goods when person gives up something like money to get good they also give up other things that they could have gotten instead this means that the true cost of something is what you give up to get it this includes money and the economic benefits utility that you didn get because you can no longer buy something else this is called opportunity cost people react to encouragements incentives making an option more attractive will make more people choose it trade can make everyone better off markets are usually good for the organisation of economic life in the free market goods will be shared by people and companies making small decisions the invisible hand of the market adam smith states that if everyone tries to get what they want everyone will be as well off as they could possibly be sometimes prices do not fully show the cost or benefit to society for example air pollution is bad for society and education is good for society the government can put tax or do something to reduce sales on items that are bad for society it can also support like giving money for items that are good for society the living standard of country depends on the skills to produce services and goods productivity is the amount of the produced goods divided by total working hours when there is an increase in the total money supply or when the cost to produce things rises prices go up this is called inflation history th century analysis of wealth physiocracy classical economics marxist economics austrian economics neoclassical economics welfare economics economists are strongly influenced by the times they live in for example karl marx lived in time where workers conditions were very poor and john maynard keynes lived through the great depression of the today economists can look back and understand why they made their judgments and try to make better ones branches of economics the two main branches of economics are microeconomics and macroeconomics macroeconomics is about the economy in general for example if country wealth goes up or if millions of people become unemployed those are things that macroeconomists study microeconomics is about smaller and more specific things such as how families and households spend their money or how business operates there are number of other branches of economics behavioral economics business economics constitutional economics development economics ecological economics economic geography environmental economics energy economics financial economics industrial economics information economics international economics labor economics managerial economics mathematical economics or econometrics resource economics urban economics public

economics he supported free markets thomas malthus he wrote about how high population can affect the economy badly karl marx he wrote book called the communist manifesto he supported communism john maynard keynes he created popular economic theory called keynesian economics milton friedman he wrote lot about monetarism and the money supply famous economists of the th and th century include

execution is where state authorities kill someone for having committed an extremely serious crime usually treason or especially terrible murders in most countries where the death penalty is still provided for by law using it is an option available to the sentencing judge even if the jury or judicial panel recommends the death penalty the presiding judge still has the option to lock the convicted person in prison for the rest of their life beheading lady jane grey probably innocent queen of england is beheaded beheading means cutting the convict head off it is one of the oldest execution methods and already mentioned in the bible beheading used to be the standard method of execution in scandinavia and germany commoners were usually beheaded with an axe and noblemen with sword special device like guillotine can also be used as in france nazi germany used guillotine to execute criminal convicts such as murderers centuries ago many countries used beheading as an execution for important people including england in england many noblemen and even some kings and queens have been beheaded there the prisoner would be led up the scaffold and usually say speech then he she would be blindfolded and put his her neck onto block then the executioner would lift up his axe and swing it down onto the victim neck if the executioner was skilled and the axe was sharp then the axe would usually cut through the bone and organs of the victim in one stroke but if the executioner was inexperienced then it may take many strokes before the head would be cut off other ways of execution the execution of emperor maximilan of mexico is painting by edouard manet it shows firing squad many countries do not allow executions as punishment any more because it is too violent however many states of the united states and some other foreign countries allow it even in the united states less violent ways of execution have had to be used here are some other ways of execution other than hanging lethal injection killing person by placing several poisons in their blood this is used as the choice of execution in most states that allow executions gas chamber person is placed in area where the air is filled with bad gases until he cannot breathe and dies this was used as an execution method in some states and by the nazis during the holocaust electrocution killing person by placing them in an electric chair and giving them very high electric shock firing squad several people shoot and kill person this execution was used in the state of utah until recently and was also often used in the united states army this method has been popular amongst the armies around the world since guns and bullets are readily available firing squad was the lawful means of execution in finland until when death penalty was abolished stopped by the law in most cases not all the people firing have real bullets after the execution it is not possible to determine which of the people firing killed the person just executed old fashioned methods garroting method of strangulation used in spain for hundreds of years crushing also called pressing used in the common law legal systems defendant who refused to plead stood mute would be subjected to having heavier and heavier stones placed upon his or her chest until plea was entered or the person suffocated hanging using rope to either break the convict neck or to choke strangulate him widely used around the world until the th century still today in use in some countries such as iraq singapore and japan drawing and quartering very violent form of execution common in medieval and renaissance europe it involved taking person organs out while he was still alive then tying him to four horses going in different directions until his body is torn apart similar thing is breaking on the wheel when wheel rather than horses is used to tear person body apart cruxifixion this method means literally nailing the convict on cross it is considered as the most painful and nasty method of all it was used by the romans to punish traitors rebels and runaway slaves death by this method may take days the convict dies from blood loss slow choking loss of water and fever caused by muscle cramps besides the roman and persian empires this method was also used in feudal japan

financial capital is form of capital it is things that have value but do not do anything by themselves they are only valuable because people value want them for example money is form of financial capital you cannot do anything with money but it still has value financial capital is used to pay for things this is because there is always more of it and people always want it this means that financial capital has stable value and can be traded in most places and with most people some forms of financial capital such as stocks gold or bonds are not wanted by everybody however they can be traded with people for money or another type of financial capital because of this these forms of financial capital do not have stable price this means that some people try to make profit by buying and selling these types of financial capital in market some things are treated as financial capital even though they do have use for example some people buy and sell land but are not interested in doing anything with it some people think this sort of trade is bad because the land should be used and not just treated like money other types of capital such as social capital and human capital are rarely treated like financial capital this may be because they involve people treating useful capital like financial capital is called comodification in politics common question is how often the government should use financial capital in particular should the government use financial capital to make profit traditionally liberal politicians do not mind this kind of trading for profit but socialist or conservative politicians are against it other pages national debt
lee smolin creator of the fecund universes theory fecund universes is multiverse theory of lee smolin it relies on models of our universe and statistics from astrophysics but is more correctly theory of cosmology in this theory collapsing stars or black holes are always creating new universes with slightly different laws of physics because these laws are only slightly different each is assumed to be like mutation of the original universe as if each universe was kind of single celled organism it would reproduce by splitting in some sense this theory relies on many models of our universe to model these mutated alternative universes the ones that smolin supposes are generated or spun off by black holes no human can ever be part of any of these other universes observations from astrophysics can only say if the black holes exist or are common and give some idea of how much the laws of physics can vary and still let the new universes produce new black holes smolin predicts that there would be many black holes in the universe humans can see since they are likely in very late born universe by simple probability if there are many black holes that is evidence for his theory as this shows cosmology has very different standard of evidence and burden of proof than is required for models of our universe only which humans using mathematics can observe and exchange knowledge on it is hard to separate science from religion on such questions it may be simple matter of preference whether one wants to see one universe as part of system like biology or like mechanics clockwork smolin theory is important mostly because it challenges the mechanistic paradigm even if it is wrong it raises the idea that living beings might have to see their universe as also living to be able to understand or care about it at all some compare smolin theory to gaia philosophy which combines biology geology and ecology to explain the earth our planet as living thing if both are right humans are on living planet in living universe this idea is very appealing which does not mean it is really right some think both are kind of religion

cooked fish in ugba recipe blue shark carp fish come in many shapes and sizes this is sea dragon kira close relative of the seahorse they are camouflaged as floating seaweed dunkleosteus giant armoured arthrodire of the later devonian up to metres long it lived in the inland seas of north america fish plural fish or fishes are vertebrates which live in water and respire get oxygen with gills they lack limbs with digits fingers toes this is definition which does not quite work some amphibia also live in water and have external gills but they are not fishes fish used to be class of vertebrates now the term covers five classes of aquatic vertebrates jawless fish armoured fish cartilaginous fish ray finned fish lobe finned fish there are more fish than tetrapods land vertebrates there are over described species of fish fish are usually covered with scales they have two sets of paired fins and several unpaired fins most fish are cold blooded poikilotherm fish takes in the oxygen from the water using gills there are many different kinds of fish they live in fresh water in lakes and rivers and in salt water in the ocean some fish are less than one centimeter long the largest fish is the whale shark which can be almost meters long and weigh tons most fish live in the water group of fish called the lungfish have developed lungs because they live in rivers and pools which dry up in certain parts of the year they burrow into mud and aestivate until the water returns fish is paraphyletic term in cladistics because it lacks monophyletic group of descendants it does not include the land vertebrates or tetrapods which descended from fish fish or fishes though often used interchangeably these words have different meanings fish is used either as singular noun or to describe group of specimens from single species fishes describes group of different species types of fish fish the oldest vertebrate group includes huge range of types from the middle ordovician about million years ago to the present day these are the main groups agnatha the jawless fish cambrian to present day pteraspids the head shields anaspids gills opened as holes silurian to end devonian cephalaspids early jawless fish lampreys living ectoparasites osteostraci bony armoured jawless fish gnathostomata the jawed fish includes all types commonly called fish except the lamprey placoderms heavily armoured fish chondrichthyes cartilaginous fish sharks rays and skates acanthodii extinct spiny sharks osteichthyes bony fish actinopterygii the ray finned fish chondrostei sturgeons and some other early types neopterygii first seen in the later permian lighter and faster moving than previous groups holostei the gars and bowfins teleostei the most successful group triassic to present day sarcopterygii the lobe finned fish dipnoi the lungfish eight genera survive coelacanths two species survive they were probably sister group to the tetrapods certain animals that have the word fish in their name are not really fish crayfish are crustaceans and jellyfish are cnidarians some animals look like fish but are not whales and dolphins are mammals for example anatomy the anatomy of lampanyctodes hectoris operculum gill cover lateral line dorsal fin fat fin caudal fin anal fin photophores pelvic fins paired pectoral fins paired bony and cartilagenous fish most kinds of fish have bones some kinds of fish such as sharks and rays do not have real bones their skeletons are made of cartilage they are known as cartilaginous fish fish scales all fish are covered with overlapping scales and each major group of fish has its own special type of scale teleosts modern fish have what are called leptoid scales these grow in concentric circles and overlap in head to tail direction like roof tiles sharks and other chondrichthyes have placoid scales made of denticles like small versions of their teeth these also overlap in head to tail direction producing tough outer layer shark skin is available for purchase as shagreen leather which as original is smooth in one direction and rough in the other direction it may be polished for use but is always rough in texture and resistant to slipping the scales are usually covered with layer of slime which improves passage through the water and makes the fish more slippery to predator swimming fish swim by exerting force against the surrounding water there are exceptions but this is usually done by the fish contracting muscles on either side of its body in order to generate waves of flexion that travel the length of the body from nose to tail generally getting larger as they go along most fishes generate thrust using lateral movements of their body tail fin caudal fin however there are also species which move mainly using their median and paired fins the latter group profits from the gained manoeuvrability that is needed when living in coral reefs for example but they can not swim as fast as fish using their bodies caudal fins muscle fish can swim slowly for many hours using red muscle fibres they also make short fast bursts using white muscle the two types of muscle have fundamentally different physiology the red fibres are usually alongside much greater number of white fibres the white fibres get their energy by converting the carbohydrate glycogen to lactate lactic acid this is anaerobic metabolism that is it does not need oxygen they are used for fast short bursts once the lactic acid builds up in the muscles they stop working and it takes time for the lactate to be removed and the glycogen replaced using their white fibres fish can reach speeds of lengths per second for short bursts swimming for long periods needs oxygen for the red fibres the oxygen supply has to be constant because these fibres only operate aerobically they are red because they have rich blood supply and they contain myoglobin myoglobin transports the oxygen to the oxidising systems red muscle gets its energy by oxidising fat which weight for weight has twice as much energy as carbohydrate or protein using their red fibres fish can keep up speed of lengths per second for long periods swimming in groups many fish swim in groups schools of fish can swim together for long distances and may be chased by predators which also swim in schools casual groups are called shoals body shape the shape of the body of fish is important to its swimming this is because streamlined body shapes makes the water drag less here are some common fish shapes streamlining the rocket shape of this shark makes it an efficient swimmer it is fast over short distances the picture on the right shows shark this shark shape is called fusiform and it is an ovoid shape where both ends of the fish are pointy this is the best shape for going through water quickly fishes with fusiform shapes can chase prey and escape predators quickly many live in the open ocean and swim constantly like marlins swordfish and tuna ichthyosaurs porpoises dolphins killer whales all have similar shapes this is an example of convergent evolution eel like the long ribbon like shape of an eel body shows another shape this enables them to hide in cracks springing out quickly to capture prey then returning quickly to their hiding spot flatfish an adult flounder has both eyes on the upper side of its body flatfish live on the bottom of the ocean or lake most use camouflage they change colors to match the ocean floor compressed fish with compressed shapes have flat vertical bodies with one eye on each side they swim upright and can be very thin they usually live in reefs where their flat bodies can slip in and out among the corals sponges and rocks keeping hidden from predators angelfish surgeonfish and butterflyfish are all compressed fish fish as food people eat many kinds of fish the fish that people eat most include carp cod herring perch sardines sturgeon tilapia trout tuna and many others person who buys and sells fish for eating is called fishmonger the word to fish is also used for the activity of catching fish people catch fish with small nets from the side of the water or from small boats or with big nets from big boats people can also catch fish with fishing poles and fishhooks with bait this is often called angling anglers also different types of fishing lures fish as pets some people keep fish as pets goldfish and siamese fighting fish are popular types of pet fish koi and other ornamental fish are often kept by groups of people in public ponds for their beauty and calming nature references related
